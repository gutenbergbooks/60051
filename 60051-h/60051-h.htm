</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
The most interesting, because most diversified, country in the world is America, and the center of that unexampled
interest belongs to the territory comprised within the United States. The castles of England, crushed by the hand
of time; the lochs and friths of Scotland, that murmur to the sea their wails of the Viking invaders; the lakes and
heaths of Ireland, around which old legends hold perpetual carnival; the Rhine of Germany, whose banks are
strewn with the relics of feudalism; the Bernese Alps, that flaunt their whitened locks like aged giants taunting
the walled cities about which the sound of battle still seems to linger; the red glare of Vesuvius, wrestling with
fiery wrath in mad ambition to overwhelm the cities built upon her ashes; the roar and blaze of Ætna, that growls with
the voice of Polyphemus thirsting for the life of Ulysses; the hills of Greece, on which a thousand gods held council; the
welling breast of Mother Nile, carrying to the sea remembrances of her ancient children; the Holy Land, blooming with
sacred memories that fill the human heart with fragrance; the mighty peaks of Himalayas, piercing the heavens with
frosted heads and draped with the fogs of centuries; the plains of Asshur, where Babylon stood, and the wrath of God
was kindled. All these, and more, speak with siren tongue to lure the traveler and give him appetite for history. But, if
we except the associations which make these places of the Old World memorable, the student of nature will find a thousand
greater charms in the picturesque, grand, marvelous and sublime scenery that diversifies our own country. No
picture has ever equaled the real, and no book has ever vividly described the wonders that God has scattered over the
American landscape. We have had glimpses of mountain, plain, lake, river and cañon, but they have been little more than
shadows of the reality, an intimation of a grandeur almost too great to depict. But as great telescopes have brought within
our vision surprising views of other worlds, the rings of Saturn, the seas of Mars, and the burnt-out craters of the Moon, so
has inventive genius been active in delineating the physical features of the earth, and through the perfection of photography
we are now practically enabled to take the world in our hand and examine it with the same convenience that we can an
orange. Travel is no longer necessary for the masses in order to behold the marvels of American scenery, for the camera
has gathered them all and lays every inspiring scene upon even the poor man’s table, to minister to the delight of his family
circle. But photography likewise blesses the traveler, for study of the picture establishes acquaintanceship with that which
is represented, while accompanying description quickens his understanding and gives a more intelligent conception of the
pictorial subject.</p>

<p class='c011'>It has been my good fortune to make many trips across the continent over the various railway lines; and business
and pleasure have taken me during the past several years to nearly all the accessible parts of the country, reached by rail,
boat or stage-coach. Always an admirer of nature, I have longed for the means to sketch or photograph the imposing
scenery which caught my enraptured eye as I hurried by. This ambition prompted the really stupendous undertaking
whose fruitage is now offered to the public in all its delicious flavor, in the form of a book as herewith submitted.</p>

<p class='c011'>How the photographic views herein reproduced were obtained may be thus briefly told, and is well worthy the
relation: This book was conceived more than half a dozen years ago, but a press of other engagements caused a postponement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>of any effort at its preparation until the spring of 1890, when the publishers engaged a corps of artists, consisting of
three of the best out-door photographers in the country. A passenger car was next chartered, which was remodeled so as
to provide comfortable sleeping quarters for the men in one end, a kitchen in the other, while the center was fitted up as
an operating-room for taking, developing and finishing pictures. Three cameras, of as many sizes, were also provided, with
three thousand prepared plates, and a great quantity of paraphernalia which might be found useful for the expedition.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>A FAMILY OF PUEBLO INDIANS, NEW MEXICO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Thus equipped, our photographic party left St. Louis early in May, going directly west to Denver, from which point we
made excursions to all the
near-lying parks, thence to
Manitou, and by way of the
Colorado Midland to Salt
Lake. Our work about Salt
Lake occupied considerable
time, and after leaving there
we proceeded to Weber
Cañon and then by way
of the Union Pacific to Shoshone
Falls. We next returned
by way of the
Denver and Rio Grande
Railroad, making a sweep
southward, through Ouray
and the Valley of the Gunnison,
over Marshall Pass
and to Pueblo by way of
the Royal Gorge. Our party
divided several times in
order to cover the territory
more expeditiously, and in
making the trip into New
Mexico one part entered by
way of Trinidad from Pueblo and the other traveled directly south through Antonito, forming a junction again at Santa Fe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some weeks were spent traveling off the line of road among the ruined villages of the Cliff-Dwellers, and in photographing
the more rugged scenery of the Rio Grande River. Then we continued our journey westward over the Atlantic and
Pacific and the Southern Pacific Railroads to California, where nearly three months were spent among the towns, Yosemite
Valley, Big Trees and mountains of that summer-land. On the appearance of spring we traveled north by way of the
California and Oregon Railroad, still making side trips by stage-coach and wagon, to Portland, from which point excursions
were made up the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. At Victoria, British Columbia, we took steamer for Alaska, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>returning we passed through the Cascade
Range over the Northern Pacific, working
our way back east. But we continued
to make detours a long way off
the main line of road, thus visiting the
Falls of the Missouri, the Black Hills,
the Custer battle-field, Devil’s Tower,
and Yellowstone National Park, in which
latter wonderland we spent two weeks
photographing its scenery and extraordinary
formations.</p>

<p>“WHALE-BACK” BOAT of the NORTHERN LAKES.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>More than three-fourths of the
grandest views were inaccessible by
rail, so other means of travel had to be
adopted. Often it was by stage-coach,
but frequently donkeys were our sole
reliance; and when these little animals
could not carry us to the most rugged
points, we shouldered our instruments
and scrambled to the peaks and abysses
of necessary observation. The difficulties,
dangers and hardships thus
encountered were both great and numerous,
while the expense involved was so
far beyond our first calculations, that
had it been anticipated in the beginning
the enterprise would certainly never
have been undertaken.</p>

<p class='c011'>We resumed our eastward journey
thence to Superior Lake, Dells of the
St. Croix, rapids of the Wisconsin, lakes
and waterfalls of Minnesota, the Upper
Mississippi through Lake Pepin, and
back to St. Louis, the entire trip occupying
more than eighteen months.</p>

<p>THE URNS, MANITOU PARK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Our camera car had served our purposes
in a most gratifying manner while
making the long tour of the West, but
in the eastern tour, which remained to
be performed, it was considered that the
car would be of no special advantage,
since accommodations are so much more
easily obtained in the built-up sections
of the East than in the thinly and sometimes
totally unsettled districts of the
West, where in many cases our car
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>was our only shelter. The journey east was begun in October, from St. Louis to Chicago, thence to Niagara Falls, and
then up the St. Lawrence. Our route next lay through the Green and White Mountains, and other famous sections of the
New England States; thence west into the Adirondacks, Mohawk Valley and Lakes George and Champlain, then down the
picturesque Hudson into the Catskills. Continuing our journey southward, we visited the points of grandest scenery in
Virginia, North Carolina, and Eastern Tennessee, and then proceeded on to Florida, where a part of the winter was spent
photographing everything worthy of a place in this volume. On the return trip Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, and
Wyandotte Cave, in Indiana,
received our attention,
as well as other interesting
places along the way, and
early in February our labors
were ended by a return to
St. Louis to put the results
in book form. Nearly all
the descriptive writing was
done while our party was
on the way, and while the
impressions produced by
the glorious visions were
fresh in the author’s mind.
This work, accordingly, is
practically one of inspiration,
the whole constituting
a story of extraordinary interest
and a history of
incomparable value.</p>

<p>ON THE OCKLAWAHA RIVER, FLORIDA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Illustrations, however
fine, whether of wood or
steel, represent the artist’s
conceptions, dashed with an
individual coloring that prevents
a natural reproduction. The painter sketches his landscape from a special point of view, and working many days
blends the sunrise with midday and sunset, the mists of morning with the clouds of noon, thus striving to please the eye
rather than to truthfully present nature, without artificial adornments.</p>

<p class='c011'>Photography, on the other hand, is the mirror which reflects nature in all her changeful moods; the absolutely
faithful reproducer of her every aspect, exhibiting her in her every-day garb, noting the disfigurements with no less
fidelity than the sublime graces which she exhibits and all the widely diversified physical features which render her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>countenance so variable that admirer and scoffer alike find reason for urging their claims. No other attempt has ever been
made to so perfectly picture the wonders of America, and the work has been so thoroughly accomplished that it is
confidently believed no one, however great his ambition or lavish his expense, will be able to add anything to the
completeness of our undertaking, as here submitted. Whatever may be the measure of deserving of the descriptive part
of this book, certainly the photographic illustrations are worthy of all praise as fulfilling the conditions of masterpieces of
American scenery, while the publishers are entitled to most generous public recognition for conceiving and so liberally
endowing an enterprise,
which has flowered in the
fragrance and beauty of this
exquisite work.</p>

<p>ON THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT TACOMA, WASHINGTON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is seemly to add that
our tour was made wholly
at the expense of the publishers.
Free transportation
was offered us over all the
railroads on which we traveled,
but all such courtesies
were uniformly refused, because
an acceptance would
have placed us under obligations
to manifest some
favoritism, and thus interfere
with the declared purpose
of the publishers to
issue a work on American
scenery in which the views
and descriptions should be
given truthfully, and without
partiality. We therefore
selected the routes which
promised most satisfactory
results, without regard to
personal convenience, having in view the ambition to present and describe the most interesting, if not always the most
famous, scenery of our country, and in so doing produce a work of which all Americans, like the publishers, may be justly
proud. In this our celebrant year such a book is particularly appropriate, and the hope of the publishers, as it is of the
author, is that our ambitious and worthy enterprise may find a warm welcome at the fireside of every American family.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi1_1'>
Enthusiasm sometimes
exaggerates the reality,
just as colored glass
confuses the sight; but
when it serves to please
without doing harm,
the fault may be pardoned. To
the enthusiasm of the occasion,
and our great and unique enterprise,
may therefore be charged
the burst of admiration that
manifested our feelings, when,
rolling along the prairies on the
Union Pacific R. R., we saw,
rising far to the southwest,
nearly one hundred miles away,
the broad shoulders of Pike’s
Peak, breaking into russet
above the clouds and showing
a head of saffron, mellowed by
the soft rays of a sun just falling
into the deep valleys of the
Occident. It was the chief
object to chain our attention for
the while, and this first impression
awakened most delightful
anticipations of the work which lay before us. A few hours later we were in Denver, making final preparations for a photographing tour
of the picturesque West. Fortunately, our arrangements were so nearly complete upon leaving St. Louis that only a short stay in Denver
was necessary, and it was with eager desire that we had our car attached to a Union Pacific train and started for the heart of the Rockies.
The long range of mountains, rising into sharp peaks, and again spreading their tops into truncated cones, elbowing and pushing each
other like a brigade in too close quarters at parade-rest, are only fifteen miles from Denver, forming a grand background to an immense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>expanse of prairie landscape. Starting on the Colorado Central Branch of the Union Pacific, we soon pass through the gate-way of the
Rockies; thence on to Golden, a beautiful mining town that nestles in the bed of a dried-up lake, and looks up with pleasing satisfaction
to the guardian gods of North and South Table Mountains. Here a stop
is made for a trip up Bear Creek Cañon, which is reached by stage, by
which conveyance the traveler is trundled into a gorge of surpassing
beauty and noble grandeur. Through this great gash the water dashes,
swollen by melting snows, and fed by a thousand sources. On either side
the frowning and dusky walls, weaving a tortuous way like the path of a
drunken giant, rear up their castellated heads until they remind us of the
walled cities of Jericho, over which Joshua’s spies were lowered by Rahab.</p>

<div  class='figright id007'>
<img src='images/i_018.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>MARSHALL FALLS, CLEAR CREEK CAÑON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Only a few miles from Golden is Clear Creek Cañon, another wondrous
cleavage wrought by water that goes tumbling through the passage
with rumble of breakers and roar of waterfall. The walls of the cañon
rise perpendicularly to varying heights of 500 to 1,500 feet, and at places
approach so near to each other that an observer looking upward from the
cavernous depths can see only a thin strip of blue sky. Away up on the
brows of the parallel cliffs are large trees that look like feather dusters,
and little streams of liquid silver appear in the distance to be pouring their
contributions from crevice and apex to swell the mad creek that rushes
with complaining voice down the age-swept gorge. Along this water-bed
was formerly the roadway, or trail, used by freight-wagons and stage-coaches,
but it is now become the exclusive thoroughfare of the Central
Branch, so that the magnificent view which the cañon affords is before
the eyes of railroad travelers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Less than three miles from Georgetown is Green Lake, an exquisite
body of water which has been very appropriately called the Gem of the
Mountain. Its translucent depths are animated by myriads of trout that
are tinged by the green waters to the color of emeralds, while away down
in its profound recesses is distinguishable a forest of stately trees which
has been swept into the lake by some glacial avalanche. Not a branch
appears to have been broken or a position disturbed, for the trees stand
boldly upright in all their original gracefulness, but through calcareous
depositions, that are a peculiarity of this lake, they have been converted
into stone. Thus it is a submerged forest of petrified trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>Looking beyond the lake we perceive, some seven miles away, the
famous Argenta Pass, the summit of which is reached by the highest
wagon-road in the world, and from this elevation an almost boundless
and marvelously picturesque view may be had, stretching away to the west
as far as Holy Cross Mount, and eastward to the prairies of Kansas.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>But we have now reached the backbone of the divide and our train
starts down the western grade, circling like a hawk out of the sky. Over immense fills, through deep cuts, across bridges, following a
swiftly-flowing stream, until at length we gain the level valley and go dashing away to Graymont, on the way to Idaho Springs and Georgetown.
To avoid tunneling in crossing the divide, the railroad winds around the mountain elevations, up a steep grade, over a way
that has been blasted out of the eternal rocks, until from away up the lofty sides the traveler may look upon a scene of marvelous beauty
and ruggedness that fades into indistinctness miles below. Leaning out of the car window we view a wondrous panorama, and pause
directly to bring our cameras into use, that the scene may be caught and held on paper. There on one side of the depths is Devil’s
Gate, in close proximity, as it seems, to Bridal Veil Falls, where the clear mountain stream plunges over a precipice of great height
to join the gamboling creek that rushes away on its errand hundreds of feet below. There, too, is a spider’s web of steel, eighty-six feet
high, that has served as a passage-way
for our train across a chasm 300 feet
wide, whose bottom can scarcely be
distinguished from our lofty eminence;
but we see that the track makes a
complete loop, and that the road
parallels itself, at a constantly increasing
grade, no less than three times.
All the while that we are winding
around and crossing our own track,
Georgetown continues visible, but it is
dwarfed by the distance to the appearance
of a prairie-dog village.</p>

<p class='c011'>The picturesqueness of the route
now changes from wild scenery of lofty
mountain and the dark awesomeness of
deep cañon, to a park-like landscape,
through tillable lands, and on to Silver
Plume, a great feat of mining engineering,
and beautiful beyond description.
Gray’s Peak rises like a giant phantom
a few miles beyond, and becomes a
charming signet in the ring of park
and town of Graymont that lies near
its feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Returning east a distance of twenty miles, a junction is reached at Fork’s Creek, where another branch of the Union Pacific leads to
Central City and Black Hawk. Here a marvelous thing is to be seen: The two towns are only a mile apart, measured by a straight line,
yet so fearfully rugged is the territory to be traversed that the distance by rail between the places is four miles, and this interval is covered
by means of a “Switch Back,” so called because of the tortuous route and the extraordinary grades. All along this vicinity are famous
mines, and a wealth of mining machinery, that converts the country into a maze of industry, and the mountains into smoking mills and
cornucopias of silver. In this mountainous region all roads seem to radiate from Denver, and hence to reach other charming scenery
by means of our camera car, it was necessary to return again for a trip to Gunnison, which is on the South Park Branch. But in order to
facilitate our work it was decided to divide
our party, so that one photographer might
proceed to Gunnison, while the other two
took the northwest route to Estes and
Middle Park, where a larger amount of
work was to be done, and which could be
reached only by stage.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Continuing our trip, therefore, towards
the southwest, our first stop was in Platte
Cañon, which is twenty miles from Denver,
and there many exquisite views were taken.
This cañon, formed by the Platte River,
resembles Clear Creek Cañon, but is longer
and somewhat wilder. The route is over
Kenosha Hill, which is Alpine in its grandeur,
and so rugged that the road is as
sinuous as the trail of a serpent. The
cañon spreads at places until it runs between
gradually sloping steeps, but again
the walls draw closer, and rise perpendicularly
to a sheer height of a thousand feet,
excluding the sunlight except as it is
strained at times through a narrow rift,
until it looks like a pencil of light cleaving
the pall of night. What mighty forces
were gathered here in the age of the world’s
infancy! what terrific convulsions and
frenzied spasms of nature that rent in twain
the earth’s envelope and left cañons and
mountains where once were lake and plain!</p>

<p class='c011'>Along the way rushes the impetuous
Platte River, that has torn and eroded a
great fissure through the rocks, and in so
doing has left many wonderful incongruities
to mark its eccentricity as well as power.</p>

<p>BRIDAL VEIL FALLS, NEAR DEVIL’S GATE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Dome Rock is one of the conspicuous
curiosities in the cañon, resembling as it
does, the top of a mosque that has sunk just
behind the wall of beetling cliff, leaving
a graceful dome as its burial monument.
But all along, at frequent intervals, spires, with cathedral proportions, shoot skyward, lending an appearance not unlike a vast row of
churches, where we may fancy nature worships, and the roar of waters is a perpetual hymnal invocation. On the same route, fifty miles
from Platte Cañon, is the Alpine Tunnel, which is reached by the road
winding about and upward until a height of 11,600 feet is gained, when,
suddenly, the train makes an abrupt turn, and leaps into the very bowels
of a mountain from which it emerges after many minutes on the other side,
and then descends towards the Pacific. This tunnel is one of the most
remarkable in all the world. It is at the highest point ever reached by
any railroad in America, and in the center of its 1,773 feet of length is
the dividing line of altitude between the two oceans. The boring of this
mighty channel not only involved the naturally stupendous labor of digging
through a mountain, but the work was rendered a hundred fold
more difficult by reason of the rare atmosphere in which the workmen had
to labor. In addition to this, 70,000 linear feet of California redwood was
required for the inside bracing, and this had to be brought up the mountain
side on the backs of burros, the only animals of burden that could make
the ascent. It was a remarkable undertaking; its accomplishment was
very like a miracle.</p>

<p class='c011'>As we emerge from the tunnel, and creep around the perpendicular
side of the mountain on a roadway barely wide enough to accommodate a
single train of cars, a bewilderingly magnificent panorama opens to us.
Away towards the southwest, one hundred and fifty miles, we observe the
lofty and regular heads of the San Juan range, while a little further west
we are able to distinguish Uncompaghre Peak, that looks down with
benignant aspect upon the town of Ouray. There, too, is the green and
happy valley of the Gunnison, towards the end of which we see Elk
Mountains and their chief peaks, Mount Gothic and Crested Butte.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this great height the snow lies packed in the deep crevices all
summer through, while upon its borders may be seen beautiful flowers
nodding their bright heads in the delightful wind that plays about the
peak. Now we go down the mountain side with brakes set, marveling all
the way at the natural wonders which have been strewn by some Titanic
hand along the route. There, on the right, are the Palisades, which
might be called sculptured rocks, so graceful and artistic that they appear
to be the creation of the great Phidias, or pupils of his school. Further
on lies Quartz Valley, like a pearl nestling in depths far below the angry
waves of giant mountains. Now we cross Quartz Creek, where nature
laughs with blossoms and fruitage, through Uncompaghre, around Hair-Pin
Curve, with the Fossil range to our right, by Juniata Hot Springs,
and at length arrive at Gunnison. We are now in the midst of the most
magnificent mountain scenery, and in the heart of a great mining country, where there is bustle above ground and activity and visions of
amazing wealth underneath. The town is at an elevation of more than 7,000 feet, but many peaks rise high above it, from which
extensive views may be had of the Elk Mountain, San Juan and Uncompaghre ranges, while to the southwest a beautiful valley stretches
away to mark the devious path of the Gunnison River.</p>

<p>THE LOOP NEAR GEORGETOWN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Having taken many views of this famous region, we turned back again to Denver, and from that point of radiation started for North
Park. Our route was by way of Boulder, at which place we took the narrow-gauge road for Fort Collins. A few miles from Boulder is
Boulder Cañon, a stupendous mountain gorge seventeen miles long, and in places the walls rise to almost the incredible height of 3,000 feet.
The falls of Boulder Creek are
not without interest, but the
mightiness and awful grandeur
of the granite cañon weighs so
heavily upon the startled perceptions
of the spectator, that
even the roar of water-fall is
scarcely heard, all the five
senses being concentrated in
that of sight. The eye is set to
climbing these terrific precipices
of stone; up, up, from
niche to niche, from wave upon
wave of dizzy height, until it
rests upon a world on high that
seems to lift its parapets to the
sky and bathe its brow in the
azure of the heavens. Can it
be that the little stream that
runs complaining along the
ravine has eroded this mighty
fissure? No, not this alone, for
water has been no more than a
servant of other greater forces
that have torn the earth into
clefts and upheavals. Bursting
volcano, denuding glacier, devastating deluge, and cooling fires of internal furnaces that brought a collapse of the earth crust, have all been
agencies in this work of mighty disturbance.</p>

<p class='c011'>The temptation is very great to step aside into Estes Park, and explore Long’s Peak, which, though thirty-six miles distant, looms
up in the clear atmosphere like a frosty-crowned giant almost near enough to speak to. But the rest of our party have preceded us and
are no doubt in need of photographic supplies, so we hurry on, pausing only long enough to take a snap-shot at Boulder Falls. Reaching
Fort Collins, we had the good fortune to find the others of our party awaiting us. They had made an extensive trip through Estes Park,
and had a splendid lot of views as a reward for their labors. It was fortunate, therefore, that we did not stop, for we could have done no
more than duplicate their work, and repeated
the experiences which they reported to me
substantially as follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>After dividing our party, as already explained,
two of our photographers followed the
Colorado Central Branch of the Union Pacific
to Loveland, at which place they side-tracked
our camera car, and having made preparations
for the trip, started west to make a tour of
Estes Park, their principal objective point
being Long’s Peak. The park is conveniently
reached by a daily stage-line, which travels
over a good road and, with the exception of a
few miles of level plains, traverses a picturesque
region, with mountains sweeping every side,
the monotony of which is relieved by many
lakes, thirty-five of which may be seen from a
single station, scattered over the plain and
bathing the foot-hills. The road leads up
Bald Mountain and Pole Hill to an elevation
that brings into view the valleys of three
rivers, and from Park Hill the whole entrancing
scenery of Estes Park, probably the finest in
Colorado, is spread out in one unbroken and
bewildering panorama of astounding beauty.
It is not all a vision of primeval nature, for
the vast table-land is abloom with fields of husbandry,
and immense herds of cattle give animation
to the seemingly boundless pasturage.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Ferguson’s ranch there is a lovely
prospect of Mummy range, with its conspicuous
peaks, aglow with the soft colors of sunset
in the evening, and mist-crowned in the early
hours of the day. On the west are the Front
and Rabbit Ear ranges, whose inaccessible
heights run up so sharply to where storms
have their breeding places, that they are
browned by exposure and look inexpressibly
bleak. Here, on these wild peaks, safe from
human foes, bear and mountain sheep have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>their habitations, and the caterwaul of the puma rings out upon the
air of lofty desolation as a warning to those who would attempt to gain
their savage haunts.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>DOME ROCK, BOULDER CAÑON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Long’s Peak is hardly more than a half-dozen miles from Table
Mountain, measured by a straight line, but to pass from one to the other
is very difficult, except by a long detour, so that the open route is by
way of Loveland to Ferguson’s ranch, which is near the base of Long’s
Peak, and from which point the ascent is best made. The east side of
the mountain is precipitous and hence inaccessible; viewed from this
side the peak appears so lofty as to almost fade into the cerulean of sky
depths, and for this reason it has been not inaptly called the American
Matterhorn. Its apex, seen from below, bears a striking similitude to
an impregnable citadel surrounded by giant ramparts.</p>

<p class='c011'>The road from Ferguson’s passes Mary’s Lake, a lovely body of
water, thence over a hill to a forest that is begirt by Lily Mountain
with its monster cliffs impending from a height of 11,500 feet above
sea-level. The ascent may be made by horses as far as what is known
as “Boulder Field,” but from that point foot climbing is necessary.
To secure the finest view, a place called the “Key-hole” must be
gained, and it is not reached without great exertion of muscle and careful
equilibrium while passing along the ledges, since a false step may
be attended by serious result. Having reached the Key-hole, the sight
that rewards the climber is sublimely grand, for he is brought to face a
vertical wall of sheer 2,000 feet, extending up to within what appears
to be one or two hundred feet of the apex. The altitude is so great
that a finer prospect, perhaps, never greeted human vision, for the
world seems to be spread out for examination. A little higher up the
scene changes, but is scarcely so beautiful, for every additional foot
taken upward increases the indistinctness of the valley below and the
mountain scenery in the distance. But by the aid of a field-glass we
make out Big Thompson River, Boulder Cañon, and some remarkable
columnar cliffs that exhibit fantastic shapes, sculptured by the erratic
hand of nature. Mountains appear like legions to the right, to the left,
upon all sides, but we are now above them all, and towards the southeast,
sixty miles away, we see a smoke-cloud that has formed from the
Denver Smelters. Still further southward are visible the hazy heads of
Pike’s Peak and its twin brother, Cheyenne Mountain, while a hundred
miles north are dimly distinguishable the range of bluffs east of the city
of Cheyenne.</p>

<p class='c011'>After gaining the summit our party had a still better view, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>a bright sun had now come out from behind clouds that had before obscured his rays, and so completely dissipated the misty atmosphere
that the panorama was greatly increased. They were lifted so far above the Front range that beyond the divide there broke into view, in
the far southwest, the Mount of the Holy Cross, while beside it were the
very pale outlines of Jackson Peak, the two almost blending into one.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>BOULDER FALLS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As they descended on the northeastern side, suddenly their sight was
arrested by a lake slumbering in a little basin that had been scooped out of
the granite sides of the mountain. It is almost immediately under the
vertical cliffs, and so clear that the observer seems to look through it, as he
would through a looking-glass, upon great walls which appear below, but
are in reality reflections of the precipice examined when making the ascent.
Lily Mountain was in bold outline on the right, where reposed another lake
of somewhat greater size, whose water appeared to feed a stream that ran
gamboling down a deep gorge into the plain which it nourished.</p>

<p class='c011'>On every side there were evidences of glacial erosion, not only in the
form of bowlders and debris, but in lateral moraines, where the glacier had
left deposits, and in gorges where great granite blocks had been tumbled,
over which in places the water cantered and fell in beautiful sheets. In
one place, towards the base, were found many small aspen trees cut down,
and most frequently the trunks were divested of their bark, and the tender
limbs were missing. Investigating the cause, it was directly discovered
to be the work of beavers, several of whose dams were perceived in a creek
that ran through a beautiful meadow land, but no one of the party was
able to catch sight of the wary animals.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our party being satisfied with their trip in the park, and especially
with the ascent of Long’s Peak, where they had secured more than a score
of magnificent photographic views, returned to Loveland to be rejoined by
at Fort Collins, as will be presently described.</p>

<p>GRAYMONT MOUNTAIN, MIDDLE PARK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>We tarried a short while at Fort Collins, then set off for Mason City,
eighty miles distant, the road to which leads through the world-famous Cache
La Poudre (Powder River) region. After leaving the south fork of this
stream we passed Monitor Peak, crossed the Big Laramie, and brought up at
Medicine Bow range. North Park proper lies west of the range, but the physical
features of the immediately eastern district are almost identical, and to
traverse the whole would have required more than a month. The park is
an elevated plain 9,000 feet above sea level, and embraces an area of about
2,500 square miles. Properly speaking, it is a fertile valley enclosed by
spurs and branches of the Rocky Mountains, and is so seldom visited that
there are as yet no resorts for travelers, and the stage is a poor reliance for
reaching the most interesting districts. We also experienced insurmountable
obstacles, which compelled us to abandon our purpose of making a tour of
the park. The only possible way of going through the district and to
chief points of photographic interest (pardon the expression) would have
been by horses, and these were not procurable because the country is devoid
of settlements; besides, we were unprovided with camp equipment.
We saw the mountains rising on every side into jagged spires, and occasional
lakes nestling on their bosoms, but they were inaccessible to us,
and after making so long a journey we were compelled to return without
accomplishing anything worthy to be narrated. Photographs of some
mineral springs bubbling up icy-cold in stony basins, wide stretches of
landscape, hemmed in by a wall of mountains, and some fine views of
scenery along the Cache La Poudre, was all the reward we had for days of
uncomfortable traveling, much of which was done on foot, and on horses
borrowed for short tours. We traversed enough of the district, however,
to satisfy us of its beauty and fertility, and that the region was a vast
game park, in which mountain sheep, bear, deer, pumas were numerous,
and ptarmigan abundant. We caught sight of several wild sheep and had
a far-away (not too far) look at a cinnamon, or grizzly bear, we were
not able to positively decide which, and not being equipped for entertaining
game of that character were indisposed to permit curiosity to
supersede judgment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Returning to Fort Collins, we retraced our route to Longmount,
from which point we determined to visit Table Mountain, near by,
and Mount Hallett, a little further towards the west. To carry this
decision into effect it was necessary to make some provision for conveyance
and camping, as the mountain cannot be explored in a day,
and a few evenings must be spent in camp in order to do the work
satisfactorily. Fortunately, supplies are easy to procure, and being
fully provided, we set out a merry party on a pleasant errand. We
reached the foot of Table Mountain towards the close of the day, and
went into camp beside a beautiful little stream that had its source somewhere
up the gorge that cleft one side of the mountain. At this point
we were also able to take some pretty views of the imposing scenery by
which we were surrounded.</p>

from that vantage point surveyed a scene of bewildering grandeur. The
wind, however, blew a gale that made our position extremely uncomfortable,
and one of our party lost his hat, that was borne away and
dropped into an abyss of almost measureless depth. There were mountains
to the west that seemed to hang on the edge of the horizon,
and down, far down, below us was an immense expanse of bowlders
that had evidently once been the sport of a glacier. Indeed, the glacier was still there, a great solid field of compacted snow that at midday
hugged the shadow side of the mountain, but was evidently moving gradually, imperceptibly, towards the gorge. Water was pouring
from the base and forming waterfalls, cascades and swift streams, showing that heat radiation from the earth was melting the glacier more
rapidly than the sun’s rays. The effect was extremely beautiful, for the afternoon sun was changing the edges of the snow-pack into
beautiful reflections of aqua-marine, and waves of light shimmered above the glacier that made the ice coverlet scintillant with color.</p>

<p>TORREY’S PEAK, MIDDLE PARK, COLORADO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Table Mountain is a truncated cone, from which fact it takes its name; but it is deeply fissured on every side, and on the west side
there is an appalling gorge, over the edges of which, in places, colossal sheets of ice impend, vast ledges they appear, threatening the
vegetation far down below, and rendering traveling along the slopes very dangerous. Having photographed Table Mountain and the fine
scenery that is tributary, we
descended and passed over to
Mount Hallett, where we were
delighted to find views of yet
greater grandeur. The way to
this mount is necessarily over
Table Mountain and into Estes
Park, the solid ramparts of
rocks which surround the park,
as far as Willow Cañon, preventing
the access of pack
animals.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gaining the base of
Table Mountain, we followed
up Timber Creek over a natural
roadway until the foot of Hallett
was reached. The way was
easy and pleasant, being level
and almost floored with moss
and flowers, while many species
of birds flitted across our path,
and in and out through the trees
and bushes, with voices of tuneful
glee.</p>

<p class='c011'>As we ascended the mountain on the northeastern side, a magnificent view was presented down a deep gorge. A little higher up,
and as we veered towards the west, we saw, a thousand feet below us, a deep, dark lake whose sides were walled, giving to it the appearance
of a crater that had now become a lake basin. Still further up the steep, in a ravine, was another lake, the edges of which served to mark
both the timber and snow line. Away off in the southeast was Long’s Peak, frowning in bleak desolation above a lake that hugged its
feet. On every side the scenery was ruggedly sublime, while immediately at our right was a great chasm with a vertical wall of stone fully
one thousand feet high.</p>

were suspicious places, where the snow was deeply impacted, which might conceal a treacherous way, a chasm bridged with nothing more
substantial than cakes of ice. Yet, on this lonesome mountain, chilled by perpetually arctic winds, swathed by eternal snows, and covered
by giant bowlders that menaced everything by their apparent instability, there was no scarcity of animal life. The mountain rat, chipmunk,
woodchuck, Rocky Mountain sheep and a few lions make this uninviting region their haunt, while ptarmigan, or mountain grouse, are
fairly plentiful. One enthusiastic photographer who climbed Hallett some years before, claimed to have found a herd of mountain sheep
so tame that he was able to take their pictures, but none of us had such good fortune.</p>

<p>FREMONT’S PASS, NORTH PARK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>At one point of the elevation we had an enrapturing view of Middle Park and Grand Lake, whose waters looked like a vast sea of
quicksilver, on which the sunlight danced in a glorious reflection. North Park might have been also visible from this same lofty point of
observation but for the intervention
of Mummy Mountain,
the monumental mark of Medicine
Bow range, far to the
northwest, too distant for our
cameras to reproduce the view
with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our visits to Table
Mountain and Mount Hallett
had proven so delightful that
our previously contemplated
trip to Middle Park was now
undertaken with the most
pleasant anticipations. Returning
to Longmont, we proceeded
over the Union Pacific
to Sunset, an arm of the road
that stretches out into the
Front range until it fairly
grasps the beautiful scenery of
that marvelously grand region.
Georgetown would have been
a more convenient point of
departure for Midland Park,
but we chose to avoid staging,
and by means of pack
animals to reach the park by the quickest, even though it was a more troublesome, route. Middle Park is separated from North Park by
an east and west sweep of the great Continental Divide, and like its northern sister is completely encircled by lofty mountains, whose
sentinels are Long’s Peak, Gray’s Peak and Mount Lincoln, with elevations above sea level of respectively 14,500, 14,200 and 14,300 feet.
The elevation of the park itself is about 7,500 feet, and its area some 3,000 square miles, or about one-third less than the State of Connecticut.
It is drained principally by the Blue and Grand Rivers, whose waters flow generally through smiling meadows until they escape from
the park. We traveled by horse through Berthoud Pass to Hot Sulphur Springs, which is on a small tributary of Grand River, and only
about twelve miles from the south boundary of the park. From this point we went to Grand Lake, the beautiful body of water that we
had seen from the heights of Mount Hallett. If the scene was grand when viewed from that distant elevation, it was sublimely picturesque
when we reached its shores. The western shore line of the lake washes the vertical base of towering mountains, which enclose it on three
sides, and throw their giant shadows into its pellucid depths, where reflections of brown peaks mingle with the beautiful green of tall
tufted pines. Its bed appears to be a glacier basin, for all about are cliffs that bear distinct marks of an ice deluge that thousands of years
ago, perhaps, invaded this retreat of nature and tore asunder the earth, ground its way through stone, scoured the face of the mountains,
and scooped a depression in the plain.</p>

<p>GRAND LAKE, MIDDLE PARK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Strange it is that near the shores of this lake the water is singularly crystalline, while towards the center it is dark as midnight.
The lake is also a treacherous body, subject to appalling disturbments from inrushing storms that first gather on the surrounding peaks and
then swoop down to break with sudden
and appalling force upon its expansive
bosom. No wonder that from time
immemorial, the Ute Indians have
regarded the lake with superstitious
fears, and tell ghostly stories of its
treachery. Upon one occasion, as an
old Indian related, a band of Utes were
encamped upon its shores, pleasantly
and profitably engaged in trout fishing.
They had their women and children
with them, and having prepared for a
stay of some weeks, they had rafts
made of pine logs, and it was from
these they did their fishing. While
thus engaged they were attacked by a
war party of Arrapahoes, their implacable
enemies. The Utes committed
their wives and children to the rafts,
which they pushed far out into the
lake, and then engaged with their ferocious
adversaries, whom, after a desperate
battle, they repulsed. During
the fight, however, a storm arose on the
lake, which quickly lashed the water
into such fury that the piercing cries of the helpless women and children were scarcely audible above the breaking waves and screech of
savage wind. When the Utes turned from pursuing their enemies, they saw that a more dangerous foe had attacked their helpless ones.
The rafts were quickly broken up by wild surges of the infuriated lake, and every woman and child was swallowed up. The Indians,
whose minds are peculiarly susceptible to impressions of a supernatural character, were prompt to attribute the calamity to a manifestation
of the Great Spirit’s anger, and since that fatal event they have regarded the lake as being the haunt of water demons, and no
Indian has since that calamitous incident dared to venture upon its bosom.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Grand Lake we followed its outlet some twenty miles south, and entered a beautiful valley of Grand River, where the grass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>was long and green, the sky a beautiful indigo-blue, and the mountain scenery around us was magnificent. A marvelously clear atmosphere
made the distance deceptive, so that peaks which were fifty miles away appeared to be scarcely five. From one point of observation
we swept the ragged horizon with our enraptured eyes, and plainly perceived a battalion of well-known mountains that locked their massive
arms around Middle Park like loving guardsmen. Roundtop lifted its head to gaze into the mysterious depths of Grand Lake; and far
beyond, Long’s Peak, the great gray sentinel of Estes Park, loomed up like a cloud gathering inspiration from the heavens. A little to the
right, Elk Mountain projects its snowy cap far into the sky and looks up into the face of its taller kinsmen. Following the waving lines
of peak upon peak, our eyes caught sight of a pass through which a river had found its way, and behind the interval were the faded fronts
of Medicine Bow range. A little further to the left there is another rent in the continuity of mountains, which closer inspection discovers
to us is Gore’s Cañon of Grand River,
where it leaves the park through a fissure
made in the eruptive rocks quite
three miles long, and in places nearly
2,000 feet deep. So perpendicular are
these cliffs that a person standing upon
the dizzy brink may drop a stone into
the rushing river below.</p>

<p class='c011'>If we look towards the southeast,
across a stretch of sage-brush, we see
the peak of heroic Powell, the most
majestic elevation in the Park range,
singular not only by reason of its cloud-piercing
height, but also because it
looks through the hazy distance like a
mountain of sapphire, while behind it
are lofty stretches of peaks with straggling
locks of white, where snow has
gathered in the wrinkles of their cheeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our rambles through Middle Park
had been so pleasant that it was with
some reluctance we turned our steps
eastward again, to pursue the work of
photographing scenery in more southerly
fields. We reached Sunset after
an absence of twelve days, and were soon after switched on to the North Branch of the Union Pacific for Denver. Thence, our route
was south to Colorado Springs and Manitou, where, as the following chapter will show, we repeated our delightful experiences in Middle
Park, and saw even greater wonders.</p>

The glory of Colorado, in the splendor of its waterfalls, the awesomeness of its mountains, the wealth of its mines, and the
picturesqueness of its natural parks, is by no means confined to those Rocky Mountain districts which we have just pictured and
described, for greater marvels remain to be spoken of, and pictorially represented. Returning to Denver, our tour took us southward,
across a plain that hugs the gnarled bosom of the Continental Divide, by the pearl of Palmer Lake, and on to Colorado Springs
and Manitou, the twin cities that sit at the feet of Pike’s Peak. Here we are compelled to pause in a spell of mighty wonderment
before the amazing prodigies of a riotously eccentric nature, that bursts into an exuberance of dashing cascades, top-lofty
mountains, darkling cañons, gruesome formations, monolithic spires, babbling brooks and magnetic springs. Here are God’s acres of
tumultuous stone, grand, amazing, chaotic, aberrant; a pantheon of forces, a Jovian council, a mythologic assemblage that sits like a
Sanhedrim on the issues of Titanic upheaval, erosion, conglomeration and elemental disturbance. There, rising like a giant specter above
its lesser brothers, and dipping
its hoary head into the milky
baldric of the heavens, stands
Pike’s Peak, the grand old sentinel
of millenniums, with sides
gashed by tumbling cataracts
and yellow with quivering
leaves of the frosted aspen. So
lofty that the stars can almost
whisper to it, and the clouds,
when tired of sailing through
the sky, circle and settle upon
its peak, while eternal night
sleeps undisturbed, save by the
lion’s call, in the deep gorges
that split its base.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first white man who
caught sight of this towering
mountain was Lieutenant Zebulon
Pike, who was sent out
by the Government in the year
1806 to make an exploration of
the Territory of Louisiana and
the Provinces of New Spain,
a district now characterized as
the great Southwest. From his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>diary of Saturday, November 15th, 1806, we quote the description of
his discovery:</p>

<div  class='figright id007'>
<img src='images/i_042.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE STALACTITE ORGAN, GRAND CAVERNS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Passed two deep creeks, and many high points of rocks; also
large herds of buffaloes. At two o’clock in the afternoon I thought I
could distinguish a mountain to our right, which appeared like a small
blue cloud; viewed it with the spy-glass and was still more confirmed
in my conjecture, and in half an hour it appeared in full view before
us. When our small party arrived on the hill, they with one accord
gave three cheers to the Mexican Mountains.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On the 26th, following, this intrepid explorer attempted an
ascent of Cheyenne Mountain, ten miles to the east of Pike’s Peak,
from which to make an observation of the more lofty eminence, which
he thus describes:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Expecting to return to our camp that evening, we left all our
blankets and provisions at the foot of the mountain, killed a deer of
a new species, and hung its skin on a tree with some meat. We
commenced ascending; found the way very difficult, being obliged to
climb up rocks sometimes almost perpendicular; and after marching all
day we encamped in a cave without blankets, victuals or water. We had
a fine clear sky while it was snowing at the bottom. On the side of the
mountain we found only yellow and pitch pine; some distance up we
saw buffalo, and higher still, the new species of deer and pheasants.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thursday, 27th November.—Arose hungry, thirsty, and extremely
sore, from the uneveness of the rocks on which we had lain
all night; but we were amply compensated for our toil by the sublimity
of the prospect below. The unbounded prairie was overhung with
clouds, which appeared like the ocean in a storm, wave piled on wave,
and foaming, whilst the sky over our heads was perfectly clear. Commenced
our march up the mountain and in about an hour arrived at
the summit of this chain; here we found the snow middle-deep, and
discovered no sign of bird or beast inhabiting this region. The thermometer,
which stood at nine degrees above zero at the foot of the
mountain, here fell to four degrees below. The summit of the Grand
Peak, which was entirely bare of vegetation, and covered with snow,
now appeared at the distance of fifteen or sixteen miles from us, and
as high again as we had ascended. It would have taken a whole day’s
march to have arrived at its base, whence I believe no human being
could have ascended to its summit. * * * * The clouds from
below had now ascended the mountain, and entirely enveloped the
summit, on which rest eternal snows.”</p>

<p>JUMBO TUNNEL, GRAND CAVERNS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Being convinced in his own mind of its inaccessibility, Lieutenant
Pike contented himself with the above brief notes in his diary,
little thinking that his name would become perpetuated in the discovery,
and that for all the ages thereafter Pike’s Peak would be one of the most
famous of American mounts.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not again was the lonely desolation of the mountain, or the marvelous
scenery about its base, disturbed by the invasion of explorers until,
forty-one years later, Geo. F. Ruxton came as a hunter to view its
grandeur and make his camp within its game-haunted shadows. Soon
afterwards gold was discovered in the vicinity, and then quickly followed
a rush of adventurers whose hardy spirit accomplished that which Pike
was fearful to undertake. An ascent of the peak was now made and
the altitude ascertained to be 14,174 feet above the sea level.</p>

<p class='c011'>Simultaneously, through the exploration of industrious prospectors,
all the many amazingly curious formations which now render the
region one of incomparable natural marvels were discovered, and the
settlements of Manitou and Colorado Springs were presently made.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pike’s Peak has been, since the time of Ruxton’s ascent, an
object of great interest to travelers, and as early as 1852 a rough foot-trail
was established to the summit, which was greatly improved
twenty years later so as to admit the passage of vehicles. In the meantime,
the towns of Manitou and Colorado Springs had grown steadily
and the number of visitors increased until some one conceived the idea
of constructing a railroad from the base to the summit. This idea was
seized upon by some eastern capitalists in 1884, and a large capital being
subscribed for the purpose, the work of building this unique road was
begun. The original company, however, met with difficulties which they
were unable to overcome for lack of capital, and in 1888 a second organization,
under the title of Manitou &amp; Pike’s Peak Railway Company,
succeeded the first corporation, and adopting what is known as the Abt
Cog-wheel System of Mountain Climbing, renewed the work thus
interrupted. As the higher altitudes were reached the air became so
rare that labor was extremely difficult, so that the strongest men were
unable to exert themselves for more than a few minutes at a time. In
place of wagons burros were employed to carry on their sturdy little
backs all the needful materials of ties, rails, tools and spikes, up the steep
mountain side, and without them the obstacles would have been insuperable.
But thus the work went on until the 20th of October, 1890,
when the last spike was driven and the highest railroad in the world
received its finishing stroke. Special locomotives and cars were built
and by the use of cog-wheels the pinnacle of Pike’s Peak was thereafter to
be gained comfortably, if not swiftly. The length of the road leading
to the summit is nine and one-quarter miles, and at times the grade seems
positively appalling (being 25 per cent.) as the noisily-laboring engine
pushes the passenger coach up the devious way, over great bowlders that
have been flung down by some Titan from immense heights above; under
overhanging brows of threatening cathedrals of stone; over mad-dashing
waterfalls; through ever-green forests of silver pines, then into groves of
dwarf aspens, until at length the route reaches up and on above the timber
line. The steepness of the way still continues, but there are no longer
abutting rocks, nor rush of water; the mountain now becomes a measureless
pile of broken stones, between which the chipmunk and woodchuck play
hide and seek; mists of clouds begin to gather, the snow line shows itself
beyond the breath of summer, and a cold wind rushes around the peak
making sport of the enterprise that invaded their frigid solitude.</p>

<p>THE CARRIAGE ROAD UP PIKE’S PEAK.—<span class="multicaption">Since the completion of the cog-wheel railway to the summit of Pike’s Peak, the older carriage road is not so much used as in former times; yet it is still preferred by many tourists who travel for pleasure or to gratify their love for the grand and the beautiful in nature. Those who have the time to adopt this slower method of climbing the mountain will be richly repaid for their trouble in the glorious view that bursts upon them at every turn of the winding way. A journey over this carriage road, either up or down, is an event to be remembered throughout the remainder of one’s lifetime.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>After two hours of pushing and climbing the train ceases its deep
respirations and stands seemingly exhausted before the stone observatory
that crowns the peak. Ah, now what a view, when the clouds pass
away and the sun bathes with golden splendor the panorama that lies in
the greater charm of indistinctness many leagues below! Towards the
west and south and north is a mighty army of mountains, in companies
and battalions, bold, rugged, majestic; always standing in review before the
Captain and Creator of worlds who seems to have halted His regiment for
inspection before an impending battle; while away towards the east
spreads the fading prairies, losing themselves in the horizon; and down
below, in a long stretch of landscape, is Colorado Springs, with its
intersecting streets looking like a corn-field, and its smoke-stacks like
scare-crows.</p>

<p class='c011'>At other times a terrible snow-storm may be raging on the peak,
while summer sunshine bathes the plains below; or, standing under the
arch of a clear sky, the summit visitor may see the rolling clouds gathering
into scrolls of darkness, and the livid lightning running through the
storm that is breaking in torrential rain away down the mountain side.
So that winter and summer, storm and sunshine, have their eternal meeting
place on the age-swept breast of this giant peak, and at this trysting
place of the extreme seasons is one of the most beautiful lakes that ever
nestled in the bosom of a mountain.</p>

<p>PILLAR OF JUPITER, WILLIAM’S CAÑON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>One of the most picturesque, grand and charming routes in the
world is Ute Pass, which starts out of Manitou and climbs around mountains,
through cañons, and emerges into a roadway that leads direct to
Leadville. The most beautiful section of this pass, however, is in sight of
Manitou, where it rises with bold precipitation around the mountain side
and passes Rainbow Falls, which has a perpendicular descent of seventy-five
feet, and looks down into Cascade Cañon, that is weirdly wild and
awesomely imposing. The beauty of the pass is not more in the rugged
margin, bordered with precipice and waterfall, than in the marvelous
coloring of the roadway and abutting rocks of sandstone which at a
distance appear like the petrified primaries of the rainbow wrapped
around the mountain.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the road winds upward a mile from Manitou, a branch strikes
off from Ute Pass, and continuing another half mile around and up the
mountain the visitor finds the way abruptly terminated by the entrance
to a giant cave known as the Grand Caverns. Like most places to which
visitors are attracted by flamboyant advertisements, these caves are not so
wonderful as they have been represented, yet they possess considerable
interest. The corridors are spacious and comparatively level, with here
and there formations of stalactites and stalagmites of considerable beauty,
though never large. Each compartment has been given a romantic and
attractive name intended to increase the imagination, and give support
to the marvelous tales with which guides entertain visitors, such as
Canopy Avenue, Alabaster Hall, Stalactite Hall, Opera House, Concert
Hall, Jewel Casket, Bridal Chamber, etc. The one principal object of
interest in the Grand Caverns—a curiosity indeed—is what has been
denominated the “Grand Pipe Organ of Musical Stalactites,” a formation
which gives forth a great variety of sounds, capable, under the
skilful touch of a player, of producing really ear-entrancing music. An
“organist” is employed to entertain visitors by performing many familiar
instrumental pieces, which, emanating from such a strange instrument,
and echoing through the torch-lighted chambers of the grotto, produce a
charming effect not easily forgotten.</p>

<p class='c011'>In another compartment, particularly dark, if not noisome, and
partitioned off by a grating to prevent profanation, are deposited some
very ancient skeletons, which are said to have been found inurned here
by the original cave discoverer in 1881. The photographer, by a trick,
has pictured these bones as gigantic in size, whereas in fact they are
slightly smaller than those of modern men.</p>

The pleasure of beholding it is also greatly increased by the assurance that it is absolutely true to nature, for the camera cannot misrepresent. Cheyenne Cañon is one of the wrinkles that sears the face of Cheyenne Mountain, some five or six miles east of Pike’s Peak, and both cañon and mountain are even more celebrated than their famous neighbor for the wildness and picturesque beauty of their scenery. This region is the Switzerland of America, except that its scenery surpasses that of Switzerland in the same proportion that America is larger and grander than the sturdy little republic of the Alps.</span></p>

Cañon, and approached by a long stair-way that leads down to a dusky,
rock-hewn platform, is the entrance to the “Cave-of-the-Winds,” as
unforbidding a place as Mephistopheles himself could choose for his abode.
This cave is nothing more than a tunnel, too narrow to admit the passage of a fat man without squeezing, and with ceilings so low as to
compel a person of ordinary height to keep a stooped position. It is up and down steep stair-ways, across chasms of uncertain depths, and
over obstructions which are quite enough to exhaust the visitor before half the cavern is traversed. The stalactites that are found here are
very small, but often clustered in resemblance of chrysanthemums and other composite plants. Like the Grand Caverns, every little
chamber in the Cave-of-the-Winds is designated by some curious or charm-impelling name, such as Cascade Hall, Canopy Hall, Boston
Avenue, Diamond Hall, Hall of Beauty, Dante’s Inferno, Crystal Palace, etc.; while the coral-like stalagmites are represented by the tricky
photographer as being of imposing size and bewildering splendor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Emerging from the stifling, half-artificial Cave-of-the-Winds, and passing down the hill a few yards, a magnificent view of William’s
Cañon bursts upon the enraptured vision of the spectator, the contrast from the dismal and disappointing cave lending additional sublimity
to the scene. The south entrance to this herculean gorge is within a short walk of Manitou,
and at the very door-way the walls rise up perpendicularly to a stupendous height and in
fantastic forms that positively bewilder with a grandeur and beauty almost unexcelled by
any scenery in the world. This gigantic gash in the mountain is evidently the effect of
erosion, the result of a rushing torrent that drove down for centuries through the pass until
it wore out a bed hundreds of feet deep and then found other outlet, or became absorbed in
the process of drying-up which the world is undergoing. High upon the sides of this
wondrous channel may be seen the distinct markings of glacial drift in deposits of shell-fish
and bowlders, while in the bed there are fragments of tufa, betraying the action of volcanic
fires which burned out ages upon ages ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two miles north of Manitou, and reached by a perfect roadway, over which carriage
driving is a supreme pleasure, is the gate-way to that chaotically curious and fantastically
marvelous district known as the Garden of the Gods. I know not who gave name to this
region of grotesque formations, but its appropriateness lends belief that it was christened by
one who had in mind the heroes of some eastern mythology, the Assyrian or Chinese, or
the witchcrafts of the Samians. The Greeks, the Romans, and Egyptians conceived their
gods as physically perfect, symmetrically beautiful; the idols of these people could never
have suggested the wild, distorted, conglomerate forms that are marshalled in this garden
of sweet confusion. Yet, the Greeks personified evil in horrid forms, and we have here
their conception of deep iniquity done in nature’s sculpturings.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old legends tell us of the Sabbat, a nocturnal assembly at which demons and
sorcerers celebrated their revels, and to the imaginative mind, stored with remembrances of
the tales wherein are described the riot of nameless things and loathsomely fearful
personages around the throne of Satan, it is easy to fancy this spot as the assembling place, and the strange forms of stone, that sit like
dumb monstrosities waiting the call of a master, as the bodies of maleficent devils petrified in the very midst of their orgies. There on
that mound squats old Sagittary, the man-beast who shot arrows of lightning from his bow, until he was struck down by a bolt of his own
forging. A little beyond is the foul witch Sycorax, the dam of Caliban, whose raven wings shelter a demoniac progeny. In that depression,
which looks afar like a seething quagmire, sits Abaddon, the promoter of wars, combustions and plagues, his face awry with fretful anxiety
to renew his course of destruction. Behind a mound, that may well be called a breastwork, stand Ægæon, Cottus and Gyges, the brother
triplets, each with a hundred arms and fifty heads, who made war upon the Titans and then stormed Olympus with stones plucked from the
core of Ætna. Still further up the hillside, protruding from a gash in the side of a giant bowlder of red sandstone, is the distorted face of
Hagen, that demon dwarf of a single eye, whose devilish claws tore out the heart of Siegfried. Everywhere, to the right and left, are these
garish and ghastly remembrancers of the tales that make children
crouch closer to grandmother’s knees, and people the darkness with
forms infuriate. But the comical side is not wanting; for nature is
protean in this godless garden of quaint conceits done in stone. If we
have cause to laugh, it is at the Brobdingnagian frog that we see to the
left of the door of the garden, sitting beneath a mushroom, with his
gaze towards the mountain. But there is a whole settlement of giant
fungi, each capable of giving shelter to a pond-full of modern-day frogs;
and we can only explain the absence of other representatives of the
croaking batrachia by the possibility that the one who has his home
under the petrified umbrella was a political boss in his time and compelled
all his followers to remain out in the rain when the big wet spell
set in. On the first rock that we pass as we enter the garden, is the
perfect outline of a stag’s head, with antlers laid back and nose high,
as if startled by the sudden baying of the hounds; while a few yards
within the entrance is a huge stone of two hundred tons weight perched
like a spinning top upon the shoulder of another, so nicely balanced
that every wind seems to threaten its stability, and yet centuries have
failed to disturb its equilibrium. Still further on, and to the left, are
to be seen a duck complete in all its outlines, and as demure as though
she was hatching a brood. Then in succession is shown an alligator
stretched out at full length, taking a siesta as natural as though it had
life. Next in this procession of statuary wonders are Punch and Judy,
peaceful folks in vermilion raiment, with faces full of righteous satisfaction,
as if they were on their way to church. Punch’s cap is a little
the worse for the long service it has seen, and Judy has a rent in her
gown, but they affect no false pride and are evidently content with
their fortune. Why should they not be happy, when within a few
yards of them there is a poor old washer-woman bending over a tub, and
a child tugging at her skirts? Certainly by contrast their lot is infinitely
more bearable. And the washer-woman has been at her hard task as
long as Punch and Judy have been on their way to the meeting house.</p>

<p>OBSERVATORY ON THE SUMMIT OF PIKE’S PEAK.—<span class="multicaption">The Observatory is built of stones collected from the immediate vicinity. It occupies the highest point on the mountain, and was erected by the Government as a home for the officers who are employed in taking meteorological observations. It is a stormy region, and a place of unrest. Many tourists assert that snow falls here every day in the year, but while this is not literally true it is always cold enough to snow, even when the valleys at the foot of the mountains are sweltering in an August sun. The altitude is so great that tourists frequently faint before reaching the top, and in other instances blood is forced from the nostrils and mouth by the terrible pressure of the atmosphere.</span></p>

<p>UTE PASS, NEAR MANITOU.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As we advance further into this museum of wonders, and turn
our eyes away from the imps, reptiles and broad-smiling people of
stone, our gaze is arrested by still stranger freaks of nature. There,
before us, in awful sublimity, is the red sentinel who guards the north
portals of the garden, flanked on either side by cathedrals and fortresses
of amazing size, and aflame with brilliant coloring. There are thin
slabs of sandstone standing on edge and lifting their heads a hundred
feet high, on which the gods or witches have sculptured images of
birds, animals, and moving caravans. A herculean lion is crouching
on the peak of one, looking towards the north, where a bear and seal
are eyeing each other from a lofty perch, uncertain of their safety,
and undetermined whether to attack or retreat. Away up on the pinnacle
of another peak sits a little old man in a rusty coat, but semi-respectable
in a plug hat, very intently contemplating a coach-and-four
driven by a pioneer stage engineer muffled to the chin in a shag overcoat,
and bowling along over the dangerous comb of the Tower of Babel.
Turning to look back, our sight is arrested by the towering form
of Pike’s Peak, and a view that is incomparably and overwhelmingly
grand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaving the Garden of the Gods, and passing massive hills of
gypsum, virgin in their whiteness and soft velvety reflection, the roadway
north lies through a large prairie-dog village, where scores of
wish-ton-wishes, of Indian name, scamper through the grass and lift
themselves into comical postures on their little mounds to watch the
carriage roll by. To the left is Glen Eyrie, where a few disaffected
gods seem to have started a small, independent park of wonders, chief
of which is Major Domo, a monolith of red sandstone thirty feet
in circumference and more than one hundred feet tall; a frowning
shaft with slightly inclined head, as if threatening the lesser forms
about its base.</p>

<p class='c011'>Five miles still beyond, nature has opened another museum
of surprises, which some human invader has named Monument Park,
but which might better be called Fiddler’s Green, or the Devil’s
Ante-Chamber, for tradition tells us that the former place is located
just five miles this side of Hades, and that all fiddlers en route stop
there twenty minutes for refreshments. This assembling place of
monstrosities; this parliament of satyr, sibyl, succuba and grim-visaged
ogres, is rarely visited, not particularly because the sights superinduce
nightmare, but probably because it is at the end of a long and dusty
way, and the gruesome formations are not numerous. The views
which delight those who love to fellowship with the incongruous and
distempered products of nature, are pillars of white—almost calcareous—sandstone
which the wind and sand have eroded into fantastic and outre
shapes, leaving a top layer of dark limestone to complete the multitude
of strange images.</p>

<p>THE DUTCH WEDDING, MONUMENT PARK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Here we find the Devil’s Anvil, apparently used by his swarthy
majesty in the dim ages in fashioning his roasting spits. And near by is
a concourse attending what is known as The Dutch Wedding, where all the goodly company are disattired outrageously, for not one has a
stitch to his or her back. But they are more decent folks than old Mother Grundy, who stands in a nook to herself, trying to gossip with
her shabby surroundings, and looking for all the world like a hag who has lost her teeth through salivation. Not far below her is The
Idiot, as repulsive appearing a fellow as ever violated the laws of nature, and who might well be the offspring of a harridan like Mrs.
Grundy. But there are other shapes and misshapes scarcely less wonderful; and if the visitor is at all imaginative, they take forms that are
variable and astounding. Doré never pictured creatures of his fancy more weird than the wind-sculptures of Monument Park.</p>

<p class='c011'>Turning back, and passing south of Colorado Springs some four or five miles, we are brought again into the Rocky range
and enter at one of the Cheyenne Cañons, between beetling
brows of tremendously high cliffs, through which a mad-dashing
water-course has eaten its way. Whether we visit
North or South Cañon, the view is augustly sublime and
awful in its grandeur. We stand in the bed of the gorge
and gaze upward on either side to a dizzy height, where the
eagles float lazily about, just below the level of the summit,
and build their nest upon the breast of the escarpment because
the apex is sky-piercing in its loftiness. Yet tumbling
down from that great eminence, where the gray spires of the
peaks are dwarfed by distance until they grow thin as
needles, is a stream of water, fed by springs that lie in the
lap of still taller mountains in the rear, rushing in tumultuous
flow until it breaks into seven waterfalls, and then
checks its pace as it joins the river that runs on to the sea.
A stair-way has been built alongside of the falls, by which
the visitor may mount to a height of two hundred feet, and
then stand upon a platform and watch the play of leaping
waterfall as it breaks into rainbows and mist below, and hear
its ceaseless song of praise mingling with the echoes that
sport between the cañon walls. They who can feel no inspiration
under the moving power of Cheyenne Mountain are
hopelessly prosaic, who close their ears against the most
entrancing hymns of nature.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not strange that the simple people who were
reared centuries ago in this cradle of natural wonders entertained
strange conceptions of the curious formations and
mighty mountains that distinguished their surroundings from other places. Indeed, it would be matter for surprise had the primitive tribes
of this region left no legends telling how Manitou, the Great Spirit, had upheaved the peaks, fashioned the grotesque images, scooped out
the cañons and set his sign of ever-flowing mercy in the welling spring and roaring waterfall.</p>

Nature does many things more wonderful than art or ingenuity of man can devise, and this is one of them.

<p>VULCAN’S ANVIL, MONUMENT PARK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Among the several traditions which are preserved, we have the fragments of the following, which appear to have been left by the
Toltecs, who undoubtedly at one time had their dwelling place in the Manitou district: A certain tribe, whose name is forgotten, living
somewhere on the great plains towards the east, were driven from their homes by a mighty flood, and hearing that lofty mountains lay several
days’ journey towards the setting sun, they fled to these for refuge. Having thus escaped the fury of what they believed was an angry god,
and found safety under the benign shadow of Pike’s Peak, they came to regard it as the dwelling place of Manitou, and instituted a form
of worship as an evidence of their gratitude. The climate being healthful and the region abounding with game, this tribe prospered and
so increased in power that they made war on their less fortunate neighbors and reduced them to slavery. In other ways they so offended
Manitou that, having once saved them from a deluge that drowned a large
part of the world, he would now punish them with another flood visitation.
And so the windows of heaven were opened, and the rain poured
down in such volume that the valley was soon overflowed, and the rising
waters began to rapidly climb the mountain sides. Perceiving that the
deluge was an infliction sent upon them for their sins, the tribe gathered
all of their possessions and with them hastened to ascend Pike’s Peak—which no one before had ever attained—to make an offering to the
Great Spirit of all that they had, with the hope of propitiating his anger. All the members of the tribe succeeded in reaching the summit,
where they prayed so fervently that the heart of Manitou relented and he consented to save the people by admitting them into heaven.
But he would receive none of their earthly possessions, and these were accordingly thrown down and in time were changed into stone, so
that by the accretion of the burdens thus rejected, the mountain became
much higher than nature had formed it. The deluge was finally
assuaged by a dragon which Manitou unchained from a huge rock in
heaven, where it was kept prisoner, and sent down to drink up all the
water. This dragon never came back to heaven, for after abating the
flood it was turned into stone and laid on Cheyenne Mountain, where
its crocodilian form may still be recognized by an observer stationed
at Colorado Springs.</p>

<div class='clear'>

<div class='multicaption'>

<p class='c011'>The two photographs on this page furnish us additional evidence of the wonders and beauties of the scenic region embraced by the Garden of the Gods and that
immediate locality. There is no other place in the world like it. Nature has run riot here in the manufacture of strange and curious things. But the names which have
been bestowed by chance upon these curiosities are not always appropriate. Needle Rocks, for instance, hear a much stronger resemblance to the ruins of some ancient
cathedral than they do to the useful and pointed instrument whose name has been unadvisedly bestowed upon them. It is quite probable, however, that the bold pioneer
who first beheld and named them was more familiar with needles than castles and cathedrals, and we can afford to let the misnomer pass with the assurance that it was
given in good faith, and it certainly does not lessen the pleasure of beholding the object.</p>

<p>MEDICINE ROCK, MONUMENT PARK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In after times, a new tribe came into the valley, and finding it
fruitful and inviting, they established their homes and prospered so
well that they soon grew mighty. For a long while no people were so
grateful and devout, so worshipful and kindly as they; but power
always begets arrogance, and in time these favored people became filled
with conceit and began to esteem themselves as the equals of Manitou
and to defy his power. This so offended the Great Spirit that he sent
a mighty host of monsters out of the north to punish the vain bigots
who thus contemned him. But some of the priests of the people had
remained true in their devotion, and these now interposed with Manitou
and made many offerings and sacrifices to appease his wrath.
They so far prevailed that many of the people also purged their hearts
of all iniquity, and Manitou was propitiated. As the host of monsters
came swooping down, like an army of invincible Centaurs, suddenly
Pike’s Peak appeared as if on fire, and the face of the Great Spirit
was visible above it, shining with a splendor greater than the sun.
On the next instant that invading army of satyrs and gorgons was
changed to stone, and it is their bodies that stand, and lie, and
posture in strange incongruity in the Garden of the Gods, Glen Eyrie,
Bear Athol and Fiddler’s Green.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many other legends are told to account for the singular formations,
but none are so old and often repeated as the one here related.
The region was certainly regarded by the early people who occupied it
as possessing supernatural features, a fact attested not alone by the
traditions so carefully preserved, but by rude carvings found on
pieces of shale dug up in the valley, and winged images carved from
gypsum, which appear to be very crude representations of a conception
of preternatural creatures. These relics, however, are very few, and
by many are pronounced spurious, so that it would be treading on
doubtful ground to attempt to introduce evidence of the faith imposed
by the Toltecs in such legends, or how they sought to perpetuate them.
It is sufficient, therefore, to accept the curiosities that are in this
wonderful garden merely as strange freaks of nature, without considering the tales handed down from a questionable source, pretending to
show that the formations are the results of supernatural causes.</p>

Having pretty thoroughly photographed the region roundabout Manitou, we hitched our camera car to a train on the Colorado
Midland and started westward for Salt Lake, and to embalm the scenery that lay between. The way led around the base of Pike’s
Peak, passed Cascade Cañon, and along Bear Creek, the road doubling upon itself and twisting around in the most tortuous course
imaginable in order to get through the mountain defiles. Every foot of the route is grand, for there is no point that does not offer
a view of scenic splendors beautiful, awesome and sublime. So rugged, tumultuous and wonderfully aberrant is the way, that the
road plunges through no less than eight tunnels in traversing as many miles, and thus the traveler is whirled through the heart
and arms of the mountains. The approach to Green Mountain Falls is up a valley which spreads out into a fascinating landscape, where
the green of the meadowlands is set in
a brown frame of sky-piercing peaks
and impending cliffs. Fontaine River
refreshes the glade that opens through
the towering range, and a little way
from the town the water goes leaping
down Foster’s Falls in a sheet of liquid
crystal. It is from this cascade that
Green Mountain Falls takes its name.
But besides this deep dash of broken
water, there are many other beautiful
falls in the vicinity which have served
to make of the place a popular resort,
indeed, one of the greatest in Colorado.</p>

<p class='c011'>Onward we speed through valleys
aflame with flowers and noisy with the
laughter of gamboling streams, until,
seventy miles from Colorado Springs,
we plunge into a gorge known by its
length as Eleven-Mile Cañon. It lies
directly in the way to South Park, and
is wonderful not so much for its darkling
depths as for its marvelous petrifactions
and other natural curiosities;
its great masses of granite that have
broken away from the peaks above and become a wall to the turbulent torrent that has cleft the mountains on its bridleless way to the sea.
Thence our train winds around, up hill, past lakes, trout streams, and ranches, until we stop a while at Buena Vista, where the train pauses
on the side of Gold Hill Mountain, fully one thousand feet above the town. From this natural observatory a beautiful view is had indeed:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Below is the madly-rushing Arkansas, and the silvery Cottonwood Creek
that joins its waters with the river at this point. Buena Vista is in a
valley that glows like an emerald in the sun, across which rises a giant
bank of mountains known as the Saguache range, in which we distinguish
the collegiate trinity of mounts Harvard, Yale and Princeton,
each being above 14,000 feet, and the former the second highest in the
Rocky Mountains. Snowy and Sangre de Cristo ranges are also visible
from this point, while eleven miles up Cottonwood Pass is Cottonwood
Lake, a very gem set in a wilderness of snow-covered peaks. It is the
same distance from Buena Vista to the summit of Mt. Princeton,
reached by an easy wagon road, and on this lofty pedestal the observer
sweeps the horizon with enraptured vision that commands a view of
Salida, Poncha Pass, the wide expanse of South Park, and grand old
Pike’s Peak one hundred miles away; Twin Lakes are twenty-five
miles to the north, near Buffalo Peaks, where the sportsman finds a
paradise and the health-seeker is exhilarated with balsamic winds;
while all around, whichever way we look, the omnipotence of the
Creator is exhibited in the mightiness of His handiwork as displayed
in the weirdly broken landscape of jocund mountain peaks, bowlders
of granite torn from the great heart of the earth, babbling streams,
tumbling water-falls, and teeming valleys.</p>

<p>THE BEARS’ CAVE, NEAR GREEN LAKE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>After leaving Buena Vista the route was along the Arkansas
River, through somewhat less rugged scenery, and on by Leadville, a
city whose life is drawn from the bowels of the mountain. The whole
territory is speckled and dotted with engine houses, and derricks, and
flumes, and cavities, where the cupidity of man has laid a tribute upon
the everlasting hills, and is collecting it by the sweat of his brow and
the exercise of his genius.</p>

<p class='c011'>The road continues to rise until we reach Hagerman Tunnel, a
mammoth passage-way bored through solid rock. Its length is 2,164
feet, and to provide perfect ventillation the cut is eighteen feet wide
and nearly as many high. The grade is a continually ascending one
from Colorado Springs to this point, where an altitude of 11,530 feet
is reached, and the slope towards the Pacific begins. Just as we
emerge from Hagerman Tunnel, Loch Ivanhoe bursts into glorious
view, a silvery sheet that wraps the cold feet of Snowy Mountain,
while off to the left, like a sign of hope to the Christian traveler, is the
Mount of the Holy Cross. This wonderful peak has become a veritable
shrine, visited as it is by thousands, whose reverent feelings it never
fails to excite. The mountain obtains its name and reputation from
the clefts on its northern side near the summit, which are in the form of a cross and in which the snow lies at such a depth that summer
suns never melt it. The height of this peak is 14,176 feet, but though not so lofty as some others in Colorado, it is apparently more
exposed and holds the snow longest, the summit being nearly always covered.</p>

This is the gateway or portal, as it is aptly named, to other views equal in all respects to this one. A tour through this region is worth the toil and effort of a lifetime, and yet how few there are who can afford to spend their accumulations in giving to themselves such a supreme pleasure.

<p>SYLVAN FALLS, CASCADE CAÑON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The next point of interest on the way to Salt Lake is Glenwood Springs, situated at the junction of Grand and Roaring Fork
Rivers. This place derives its importance from its numerous thermal springs of great remedial virtues, and the beautiful adornments which
a lavish but well-directed use of money has provided. The situation, too, is one of great natural picturesqueness, as the scenery rivals that
about Manitou. Glenwood Springs is located at the head of Grand River Cañon, which extends a distance of sixteen miles through
colossal mountains, the palisades
of which rise in serried
ranks and terminate in towering
columns and gigantic turrets
frequently 2,000 feet above
the bed of the river. It is
through this tremendous chasm
that the railroad runs, so that
travelers have a perfect view of
the Titanic scenery from the car
windows, as they are whirled
through it. Three miles from
Glenwood Springs is No Name
Cañon, while further up the
stream is a tremendous fissure
which admits the river, and on
account of its wildly savage appearance
is called Grizzly
Cañon. Ten miles more towards
the river’s source is Dead
Horse Cañon, which may be
gained only at the expense of
most laborious effort, for the
trail is over great bowlders and
along crumbling walls which
frown far above the roaring
waters below. But away up in
this darksome retreat of nature, where the lion and bear have their haunts, is Meteor Falls, that leaps almost out of the mouth of the cañon
and hurls its waters down a precipice nearly one hundred feet deep, and then spreads through crevices of the rocks into a score of separate
streams. Not far distant is Alexander’s Cave, which, though not so well known, is much grander in size and more curious with stalactite
formations than those near Manitou, which have an undeserved fame. From the summit of a mountain just east of Glenwood, and reached
by a walk of three miles, an immense expanse of charming scenery is viewable. For seventy miles towards the east extends the snow-crowned
chain of the Continental Divide, while towards the north, like a babe sleeping to the lullabys of a brooklet’s voice, lies the White River
plateau. Southward the observer’s vision swings across the valleys of
Roaring Fork and Crystal River to the Elk range, and then sweeps around
to the west, where it lingers on Book Cliffs, ninety miles away, which
gleam with scintillant beauty, and inspire with a grandeur that fills the
very soul with wondering ecstasy.</p>

<p>TRIPLE FALLS, CASCADE CAÑON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The tumultuous anarchism of nature, the wild riot of natural
forces, the savage disarrangement, the chaotically indefinable throes of
internal madness that characterize the region, suggests other wonders of
eruption and erosion, the dissolution and disorganization which have been
wrought along the water-course and which has gnawed its way through
these everlasting—nay, it would appear, transitory—mountains. The
first travelers that fought their way into these vastnesses of cañon, roaring
peak and soughing forests, carried back to civilization wondrous tales of
the things which they had seen, and though discredited as the conceptions
of perfervid imaginations, others were stimulated to seek the proofs,
and confirm the theories that were offered by adventurous gold-hunters.
The Government itself, unconscious of its own possessions, joined in the
search for the wondrous evidences and sent expeditions into the Rocky
Mountain regions to make topographic and geologic investigations, the
results of which were to increase surprise. Operations in the west,
chiefly against the Mohave Indians, made it necessary also for the Government
to ascertain the most convenient routes for the transportation of
supplies to the military posts in New Mexico and Utah, and in this search
the Colorado River became an object of special interest, because if navigable
it presented the easiest way to the seat of war. In order to determine
the question, an expedition was despatched by the Secretary of War,
in 1858, under the command of Lieutenant J. C. Ives, chief of topographical
engineers. An iron steamboat fifty feet long was built in Philadelphia,
which, being in sections convenient for transportation, was shipped
by way of Panama to the Gulf of California, and put into service at Fort
Yuma, at the mouth of the Colorado River, for an ascent of that stream.</p>

<p class='c011'>The expedition thus conducted by Lieutenant Ives resulted in
the exploration of a large territory which was before his advent therein
a <i>terra incognita</i>, except that it had been partially traversed in 1540 by a
few Spanish explorers, acting under orders of the Viceroy of New Spain,
whose reports, however, were so crude as to be almost valueless. Ives
succeeded in ascending the Colorado a distance of 425 miles in his steamboat,
which he concluded was within seventy-five miles of the head of
navigation during the most favorable season. The practical results were not of very great value, but his reports were extremely interesting,
chiefly for the descriptions of marvelous scenery which they contained. Or, as he writes, “The region explored after leaving the navigable
portion of the Colorado—though, in a scientific point of view, of the highest interest, and presenting natural features whose strange sublimity
is perhaps unparalleled in any part of the world—is not of much value.”</p>

<p>NEAR HANCE’S CABIN, GRAND CAÑON OF THE COLORADO.—<span class="multicaption">The Grand Cañon of the Colorado, in Northwestern Arizona, is the supreme natural wonder of the world. It is formed by the Colorado River cutting its way through the high plateau of that region. It is not a mountainous district, but a level plateau, and for this reason the tourist sees no indication of the wonders soon to be unfolded to his astonished vision until he is right upon the brink of the awful chasm which gashes the earth in many places to a depth of more than one mile, at the bottom of which the river writhes and dashes like a tortured serpent. The towering cliffs on either side reflect all the colors of the rainbow, and when they are illuminated by the noonday sun the scene is indescribably beautiful as well as grand.</span></p>

<p>TEN-MILE PASS, NEAR KOKOMO, COLORADO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Subsequently the Government determined to effect an exploration of the headwaters of the Colorado, and to this end Major J. W.
Powell, chief of the U. S. Survey Corps, was sent out in charge of a party of a dozen equally intrepid men, with instructions to descend
the stream if possible. To accomplish his purpose Major Powell provided four staunchly-built row-boats in which he and his party debarked
at Green River Station, on the 24th
of May, 1869, to run the gauntlet of
cañon, maelstrom, rapids and waterfalls
in the Green and Colorado Rivers.
It is to Major Powell’s report
that we are indebted for descriptions
of the terribly sublime scenery of these
two streams, which surpass in wonder
every other region on the globe, and
to the photographer of that expedition
we make our acknowledgments for
several of the views which are here
reproduced. Mr. W. H. Jackson, who
was for a long while attached to the
survey corps as photographer, has also
kindly furnished us with a number of
exquisite pictures of the more accessible
cañons of the Colorado, and to
him, therefore, credit in large share
must be given. Our own party, while
thoroughly equipped for photographing
regions contiguous to railroads,
was unprepared for making a trip
down the most dangerous of rivers,
and we have accordingly been compelled
to rely for our photographs of
the Green and Colorado Cañons upon the work of those above credited. Condensing as much as possible the elaborate and entrancing
report of Major Powell, as it fills a very large volume, his explorations may be thus hastily described:</p>

<p class='c011'>Almost from the beginning of the trip, the scenery was delightful, variegated as it was with high-reaching cliffs dyed in great variety
of colors, and long lines of mountains stretching away into an infinity of distance. The blue sky above, green shades of forest pines along
the side, empurpled clouds catching the tints of a rising and setting sun, and lines of buff, red and brown, marking the strata of the banks,
made a picture which no painter has the genius to reproduce. Green River enters the Minta plateau by the Flaming Gorge, and after
reaching the heart of the chain turns eastward, then southward, cutting its way out by the splendid cañon of Lodore. Then following the
base of the range for a few miles a sudden caprice
seizes it. Not content with the terrible gash it has
inflicted upon this noble chain, it darts at it viciously
once more and cuts a horseshoe cañon in its flank
2,700 feet deep, then twists and emerges near the
point of entrance. Thenceforward the river runs a
tortuous course of 300 miles through gently inclined
terraces which rise gradually as the stream descends.
Further down, the Kaibab (Buckskin) Plateau rises
to contest its passage, and a chasm 5,000 to 6,000
feet is the result. The whole province is a vast category
of instances of river channels cutting through
plateaus, mesas, and terraces where the strata dip up-stream,
as will be more particularly described in the
summary of Major Powell’s hazardous explorations.</p>

<p>KAIBAB PINNACLES, GRAND CAÑON OF THE COLORADO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Sixty miles from Green River the expedition
floated into Flaming Gorge, a chasm fifteen hundred
feet in depth, through which the water poured in
swift measures and gave intimation of a more impetuous
course further down. But undeterred the gallant
party proceeded, through Red and Horseshoe Cañons,
where the walls drew closer and big bowlders in the
stream caused the water to boil with such ominous
signs that portage around the obstructions was necessary.
Thereafter the way became more difficult, for to
dangerous rapids were added lofty falls, while along
the vertical walls in places there was scarcely a space
to set foot. Frequently the only possible means of
passage was by lowering the boats by ropes attached
to stem and stern, which taxed the strength of the
men as well as the staunchness of the crafts. Time
and again, in running rapids, the boats were capsized,
but being built in water-tight compartments they
righted themselves and were a refuge for the men,
who clung to the sides until they drifted near the shore.</p>

<p class='c011'>At one place, which Major Powell named Disaster
Falls, one of the boats was swept over a fall and
carried down to a rapid, where, striking broadside
against a bowlder, it was broken in two, leaving the
three occupants adrift to battle with the surging
waters. Their escape from drowning was almost a
miracle, due to good luck and the extraordinary efforts
of their brave comrades. In this spot the walls were
more than 3,000 feet high, and drawn so near together
that only a thin strip of sky was visible, which at
night-time appeared to rest on the jagged edges of
the cliffs.</p>

The space is too limited, however, to show the towering heights of the cliffs to the right, which, when viewed from this standpoint, seem to bathe their faces in the blue vault of heaven. Along these cliffs, in many places, are found the deserted homes and the ghastly relics of an ancient race of men, long since perished from the face of the earth. They made their dwelling places in this rugged and secluded region as a protection against wild animals and still wilder savage men, but with all their precaution they were unable to shield themselves from the fury of their enemies, and another chapter of mystery and sorrow is thus added to the history of man.</span></p>

<p>HORSESHOE CAÑON, GRAND CAÑON OF THE COLORADO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Sixteen days after their departure from the
starting point, the adventurous party were swept into
Lodore Cañon, which extends its colossal walls along
twenty-four miles of the river, sometimes in the form
of hanging cliffs, tousled and gray with stunted vegetation,
and rising nearly three thousand feet above the
stream, and again in beautiful terraces of red sandstone
that spread upward till they are lost in the
Uintah Mountains.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not until two months after leaving Green
River Station that the explorers approached the junction
with Grand River. As they dropped out of the
winding gorge whence they had descended, they
caught a view of a wondrous fissure, down which
poured a rushing stream which appeared to issue from
the very bowels of the earth, so bottomless seemed the
channel. It was Grand River, which, in many respects,
is the counterpart of its sister stream, having
the same features of waterfall, rapid, and awesome
cañon, into which the sunlight falls only at midday,
and where night-birds are on the wing almost constantly.
It is a fitting thing that these two remarkable
rivers should mix their fretful waters and flow on
together in a perpetual quarrel, through arid plains,
until they end their differences in the Gulf of California.</p>

<p>JURASSIC TERRACE OF THE CALAB, GRAND CAÑON OF THE COLORADO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Colorado River is formed by a union of the
Grand and Green Rivers, the former taking its rise
near Long’s Peak, and the latter having its source in
the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming, within a few
miles of Fremont’s Peak. The two streams form a
junction near a point known as Fort Morrison, in
southeast Utah, at the head of the most appalling
gorge in the world, called the <i>Grand Cañon of the</i>
<i>Colorado</i>. The scenery along both the Grand and
Green Rivers is inexpressibly sublime, rising into towering
buttes out of the plains; soaring to the clouds in
the form of mountains; revelling in the wildest disorder
of landscape, and the most turbulent panorama of mad-dashing
streams between walls of amazing height; but
the wild passions of both rivers seem to be united with
more than double intensity when they mingle their
waters and thence become one turbid flood gnawing a
way through the southwest desert. How hard it is
for the inexperienced eye to catch a mental view of
the tremendous chasm of the Colorado, however realistic
a descriptive writer may paint it, for height and
depth almost lose their significance when we apply
the terms to dizzy crags above, and the dark lonesomeness
of Plutonian recesses beneath.</p>

<p>SKULLS OF THE CLIFF DWELLERS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The region through which the chafing waters
of the Colorado run is forbidding in the extreme, a vast Sahara of waste and inutility; a desert too dreary for either vegetable or animal
life; a land that is haunted with wind-storm, on which ride the furies of desolation. But there is in its very bleakness and consumptive
degeneracy something that appeals to the observer; a sympathy is aroused that stimulates contemplation of the wondrous works of Deity, of
the omnipotent hand that sows seeds of plenty in one place and scatters tares of poverty in another; that makes the valleys to laugh with
verdure, and the plains to wail with nakedness. In this sterile domain, this borderland of phantasy and reality, nature is so distraught
that the supernatural seems to hold carnival, and in the forms which we here behold there is constant suggestion of chaos. The earth is
parched to sterility, and yet there are abundant evidences that in centuries long ago this same land was abundantly blessed with an amazing
fertility. Depressions ramifying
the region are the dry beds
of what were once water-courses,
and the whole plateau
is garish with rocks over
which life-giving floods once
poured their vivifying nourishment.
But the friable nature
of both soil and rock has given
way before the action of the
river, which has constantly
deepened its path and drained
the moisture from the earth.
Now it is like the Moon, a
parched district, save for the
single stream which, instead of
supplying sustenance, is eating
its vitals. The channel is worn
more than 5,000 feet deep, with
stupendous banks terraced and
wrought into shapes most fantastic,
and at places diabolic.
Imagine a chasm that at times
is less than a quarter of a mile
wide and more than a mile deep,
the bed of which is a tossing,
roaring, madly impetuous flood;
winding its way in a sinuous course along walls that are painted with all the pigments known to nature! What an imposing spectacle;
what a scene of awesome grandeur; what a sublime vision of mightiness! But the geologist sees in the crags and precipices, the strata and
bed of that brawling stream, the handwriting of nature, the easily decipherable physical history and geology of the land. The antiquarian
and ethnologist, following after, translate the relics of rude habitations found along the cliffs, and the skulls fortunately recovered from the
ruins, into a story of the ancient people who in the long centuries ago dared to make their homes in these almost inaccessible fastnesses,
driven to such refuges by the ruthless hand of persecution.</p>

<p>ROTARY SNOW-PLOW.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In many places, Major Powell found overarching cliffs, formed by the river in making a sharp bend eating away the shale and
gypsum of the base. Occasional inlets were observed, cut by creeks that have been dried up for ages; and following up one of these deep
aroytas a little way, he came to a natural stair-way of small and regular terraces that led up fully 500 feet, to an oasis of vegetation, out of
which burst a spring that lost its waters before they had run a hundred feet down the parched cliff. Just below this point a beautiful glen
was found, where the walls of the cañon appeared to almost meet above the deep and quiet river, which, though narrowed, had an
unobstructed channel. The
cliffs were of a marvelous
beauty, appalling in height, but
as variegated as a bed of poppies,
with their strata of white,
pink, saffron, gray and red.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing out of Glen
Cañon, the party came directly
into the jaws of another chasm,
where the river had excavated
an amphitheater of mammoth
proportions, and then plunged
into a gorge where both the
walls and bed of the stream were
of marble so pure that they
shone with an iridescent splendor,
and the now lazy river
reflected its walls until looking
down was gazing into the
heavenly depths. Just below
was Cataract Cañon, the entrance
to which was indicated
by a lofty cliff that, from a
distance, shone like a crystal
mountain, but which, on closer
inspection, was discovered to
be the source of many springs
whose waters glinted in the sun
like jewels.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ruins of the ancient city of Casa Grande, in Arizona, and others not less wonderful in the same region, prove that this
portion of our country was once inhabited by a powerful and numerous race of people, who possessed a civilization and knowledge
of the arts on a parallel with Babylon and Assyria. The walls of these ruins are built of adobe, thick and strong, and guarded with
buttresses and towers to meet and repel the attacks of an enemy; but their age and the date of their occupancy cannot be determined.
They may be a thousand years old, and it is just as probable that they date back two or three times that distance into the unknown
past. Their origin is a profound mystery, and must always remain such.</p>

<p>BRIDAL VEIL, SHOSHONE FALLS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In many places the arid
desolation which was noticeable in the upper portion and on the plateau, and which stretched away on both sides, was broken by patches
of vegetation, and the appearance of side gorges in which creeks were still contributing to the river. Storms were not infrequent, too, and
these occurring where the cañon walls were a mile high and close together, produced an effect that was almost supernatural in its awfulness.
Every obscuration of the sun brought dense shadows in the chasm, which were split in twain by blinding flashes, while the deep thunder
echoed sharply between the cliffs, producing a roaring sound that was almost deafening. Such rain-storms, however, were invariably
confined to the immediate vicinity of the cañon, the territory lying two or three miles east or west continuing parched, with hardly
a cloud above it. Even more remarkable than the stupendous walls which confine the Colorado River, are the ruined cave habitations
which are to be seen along the lofty and apparently inaccessible ledges, in which a vanished race long years ago evidently sought
refuge from their enemies. These caves are no doubt natural excavations, but in many instances the mouths are partially walled
and otherwise fortified. They were reached by very narrow, precipitous and devious paths, and being extremely difficult to attain
by the occupants themselves, presented an impregnable front to invaders. But the security which such cavernous retreats afforded
was purchased at great cost, for we wonder how the inhabitants managed to exist, situated as they were in a desolate country, where
there was great scarcity of both vegetable and animal life. Perhaps the most strikingly beautiful sections of the Grand Cañon are
the Vermilion Cliffs, and the Temples
and Towers of the Virgin, the one
fading into the other. Vermilion Cliffs
are a great wall of remarkable height
and length of persistent proportions,
and so ornate with natural sculpturing,
and rich with parti-coloring, as to
justify the most extravagant language
in describing them. Each of the
several terraces has its own style of
architecture, and yet they contrast with
one another in the most harmoniously
artistic manner. The Elephantine
ruins on the Nile, the temples of
Greece, the pagodas of China, and the
cathedrals of Southern Europe, present
no more variety of pleasing structures
than those encountered in descending
the stair-way from the high plateaus to
the deep Cañon of the Colorado. As
we pass from terrace to terrace, the
scene is constantly changing; not only
in the bolder and grander masses
which dominate the landscape, but in
every detail and accessory as well: in
the tone of the color-masses, in the vegetation, and in the spirit and subjective influences of the scenery. The profile of the Vermilion
Cliffs is very complex, though conforming to a definite type and composed of simple elements. While varying much in different localities,
it never loses its typical character. The cliffs consist of an ascending series of vertical ledges, rising story above story, with intervening
slopes covered with heaps of rocks, through which project their fretted edges. The composite effect given by the multiple cliffs and
sloping water-tables rising tier above tier, is highly architectural, and shows in striking contrast with the rough and craggy aspect of the
cliffs of other regions. This effect is much increased by the aberrant manner in which the wall advances in promontories or recedes in
alcoves, and by the wings and gables that jut out from every lateral face. In many places side cañons have cut the terrace platforms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>deeply, and open in magnificent gate-ways upon the broad desert plain in front. We look into them from afar, wonderingly and questioningly,
with our fancy pleased to follow their windings until their sudden turns carry them into distant, unseen depths. In other places
the cliffs verge into towering buttes, rearing their unassailable summits into the clouds, rich with the aspiring forms of a pure Gothic
type, and flinging back in red and purple the intense sunlight that is poured upon them. Could the imagination blanch those colors, it
might compare them with vast icebergs, sent from the face of a glacier and floating majestically out to sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>Grand, glorious, sublime, are the pictorial cliffs of vermilion hue; yet a more magnificent spectacle is presented by an unfolding of
the panorama that stretches southward, revealing as it does the heavenly crowned and resplendently painted temples and towers of the
Virgin. Here the slopes, the serpentine ledges, and the bosses of projecting rock, interlarded with scanty soil, display all the colors of the
rainbow, and in the distance may be likened to the painter’s palette. The bolder tints are of maroon, purple, chocolate, magenta and
lavender, with broad bands of white laid in horizontal belts. The cañon proper is 7,000 feet deep here, but less than two miles beyond it
stands the central and commanding object of this sublime painting, the glorious western temple that looms up 4,000 feet above the rapid river.
This, however, is only the foreground of a matchless panorama, for right opposite are a mighty throng of structures wrought in the same
exalted style, separated by two principal forks of the Virgin, known as the Parunuweap and the Mukuntuweap, or Little Zion Valley. At
one point the two side cañons swing around and form a junction, where the walls break into giant pediments covered with the most remarkable
and picturesque carvings. The sumptuous, bewildering and mazy effects are boldly discernible; but detail is lost when attempt is
made to analyze it. The flank of the wall receding up the Mukuntuweap is similarly sculptured and decorated for two miles, and then
changes into new kaleidoscopic forms still more wonderful and impressive. A row of towers half a mile high is sculptured out of the
palisade, and stands in relief before its face. There is an eloquence in their forms which stirs the imagination with a singular power, and
kindles in even the dullest mind a glowing response. Just behind them, and rising a thousand feet higher, is the eastern temple, crowned
with a cylindric dome of white sandstone. Directly in front is a complex group of white towers, springing from a central pile and
mounting to the clouds. The highest peak in this cumulus mass is almost pure white, with brilliant streaks of carmine descending its
vertical walls, while the truncated summit is a deep red.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nothing can exceed the wondrous beauty of Little Zion Valley, which separates the two temples and their respective groups of
towers. In its proportions it is probably equal to Yosemite, but it very far exceeds that natural wonder in the nobility and beauty of
sculpturing. We are not surprised that a Mormon zealot gave to this cañon the name of Little Zion, since the scenery is so imposing as to
immediately and powerfully suggest those “houses not built with hands.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Far to the westward is to be seen the last palisade, lifting its imposing front behind an army of towers and domes to an altitude of
more than 3,000 feet. Beyond it the view changes quickly, for it passes at once into the Great Basin, which to this region is another world.</p>

<p class='c011'>The passage of the Grand Cañon of the Colorado, that most fearful, colossal and extraordinary chasm in all the world’s surface, was
completed on August 29th, the perils which beset the explorers being constant and the hardest work unremitting. Nor was it accomplished
without great sacrifice. The dangers so increased that three of the men deserted, whose fate, however, was most tragic, for they were
shortly afterwards murdered by Indians. Starvation threatened the party, for repeated capsizing of the boats resulted in the loss of nearly
all their provisions, while exposure brought on illness, so that the men were in a desperate situation when they finally emerged from the
jaws of the cañon and found succor among some hospitable Indians.</p>

Throughout a great part of its length the bed of Parunuweap is a cañon of enormous depth and precipitous sides, into which, at frequent intervals, streams that are suddenly swollen by heavy rains pour their overflow.

Grand River valley is followed by the railroad from a point about forty miles north of Leadville for a distance of nearly two
hundred miles, and until State Line is reached, when the road cuts across the plains of Utah, which are relieved by little diversity
of landscape until Mount Nebo, of the Wasatch range, breaks into view. The scenery along Grand River is, however, extremely
beautiful, being very rugged and at times mountainous. The road leads through several cañons that have very high vertical walls,
around ledges, over bridges, and takes an occasional plunge into the midnight of tunnels bored through solid granite. The
landscape which meets the traveler’s vision when he reaches Utah is very different from that which characterizes Colorado, the
difference being apparent almost when the border is reached. After passing the plateau the route is by Provo Lake, where the region
becomes broken, and near-by are
lofty ledges, over one of which
rushes a pellucid stream that is
formed by melting snows from
the adjacent mountains. Provo
Falls is a beautiful sheet of
water, dashing down a height of
forty feet and then spreading
away until lost in Provo Lake.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Wasatch range is now
plainly visible, coasting the eastern
shore of Great Salt Lake,
and winding around to the
southwest until they enclose a
valley that by Mormon industry
has been converted into a veritable
paradise, ramified as it is
by canals that render it prolific
with nearly everything that fertile
soil can produce.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Wasatch range forms
one of the most important topographical
features of the Cordilleran
system; in fact, it marks
the central line of elevation of
this great mountain region, and
is the dividing ridge between the arid interior basins of Nevada and the high and relatively well-watered plateau country that drains into the
Gulf of California. All the mountain formations here are on a scale of universal magnitude, while in their structure are to be seen the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>effects of dynamic forces, which have folded and twisted thousands of feet of solid rock as if they were as pliable as so many sheets of paper.
To the westward the range presents a bold, abrupt escarpment, rising suddenly out of the plains of the Utah basin, and attains its greatest
elevation within a couple of miles of its western base. To the eastward it slopes off very gradually, forming a succession of broad ridges
and mountain valleys whose waters drain into the Great Salt Lake through cañons and gorges cut through its main western ridge.
The altitude is from 10,000 to 12,000 feet above sea level, so that snow is continuous on the summits, while a condensation
of the eastward moving atmospheric currents, produced by the chill on the mountain peaks, furnishes a constant supply of water to
the mountain streams, and from which the valleys derive their exceptional fertility. A view of the range, as observed from one of the
islands in Salt Lake, presents a mountain wall more than
100 miles in length, of delicately varied outline, the
upper portion wrapped in a mantle of snow, but dotted
with patches of pine revealing all the intricacies of its
rocky structure, and cut through at short intervals by
deep cañon gashes of rare grandeur and beauty. A
striking feature is presented in the old lake terraces
which mark the former beach-line of ancient Lake Bonneville,
of which the uppermost is 940 feet above the level
of the present lake, and can be traced with few interruptions
from one end of the range to the other. Lake
Bonneville was formerly the great inland sea of which
Great Salt Lake is now a part. It covered nearly one-sixth
of what is now Utah territory, and there is evidence
that it was connected with the sea by an arm extending
to the Gulf of California. The upheaval of mountains
through volcanic action reduced its bed and gradually
confined its waters to the lower basin of what afterwards
came to be known, because of its saline waters, as the
Great Salt Lake.</p>

<p>BLACK ROCK, GREAT SALT LAKE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As early as 1689 mention was made of this remarkable
lake, which was somewhat indefinitely located and
described by Baron La Houtan, “lord-lieutenant of the
French colony at Placentia, in New Foundland,” in a
work which was first published in the English language
in 1735. But though known at such an early day, it was
not until 1849 that a survey of the lake was made by
Howard Stansbury, captain of topographical engineers, U. S. A., though General John C. Fremont circumnavigated it in 1844, giving
names to its several islands and prominent points. The settlement of Mormons in the Salt Lake Valley, near the shores of the lake, served
to bring the Dead Sea of America into prominence, and to this fact was largely due the action of the Government in ordering a survey of
the great basin to be made. The lake was found to be nearly eighty miles long by fifty broad, and to contain such a quantity of salt,
sulphates of silver, chlorides of magnesium, potash and alum, that its solid contents were about four times greater than that of ocean water,
while its specific gravity almost equalled that of the Dead Sea. Having no outlet the lake has a fluctuating level, dependent upon the
amount of inflowing water and solar evaporation, which varies each season, but though theoretically the lake ought to be diminishing, the
fact remains that it is rather increasing, showing marked encroachment on the eastern shores, while on the west there is an apparent
recession of its waters, a peculiarity not easily explained.</p>

<p>THE TEMPLE, SALT LAKE CITY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There are a number of islands in Salt Lake, the two largest being Antelope and Stansbury, which rise abruptly to a height of
3,000 feet, terminating in rocky ridges that range north and south, and from which a marvelously beautiful view is had of the
surrounding scenery, varied by towering peaks, boundless plains, fields of grain, irrigating ditches, prosperous farm houses, and away to
the southeast a delightful vision of Salt Lake City. Other islands in the lake are those known as Gunnison, Fremont, Carrington,
Dolphin, Black Rock, Mud,
Egg, Hat, and several others
that are so insignificant as to
appear to be unworthy of any
name. The total area covered
by the lake is about 2,500
square miles, or nearly 400
square miles more than the State
of Delaware, and its elevation
above the sea is 4,000 feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if Great Salt Lake is
one of the prime curiosities of
America, its municipal namesake
may well claim the distinction
of being one of the
artificial wonders of our land.
Salt Lake City is the sublime
result of Mormon persecution,
having been founded by that
alien sect in 1847. The history
of their expulsion from Nauvoo,
Illinois, and Gallatin, Missouri,
is familiar to every school-boy,
yet there will ever linger about
the story of their flight, across
the winter-swept plains of Iowa
and the icy prairies of Nebraska, to the desert lands of Utah, a glamour of romance, second in interest to that of the exile of the Acadians, as
told by Longfellow in <i>Evangeline</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this valley of desolation, as it then appeared, Brigham Young, the Moses of his people, founded a city and re-established a
hierarchy which has persisted and prospered to a degree that invites the world’s amazement. By industry as remarkable as it was well
directed, the desert was converted into an oasis, and the bare earth, with its poverty of sand and sage-brush, was made to cover its nakedness
with the green vestures of almost unexampled fecundity.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>The town thus established under harsh conditions grew into the stature of a city, whose very isolation seemed to contribute to its
prosperity. For the first score of years the place was in nearly all respects one of refuge, where the church was dominant and where
priestcraft and polygamy were the two institutions upon which the life of the sect depended. We are not surprised, therefore, to find that
the first great building erected in Salt Lake City was a tabernacle, with a seating capacity for 12,000 persons, the largest hall without pillar
supports in the world, and that next to this a tithing house was built, for it was a principle with the Mormons that the church should be
supported by levies upon the communicants of one-tenth of their annual profits, whether such earnings came from the soil, merchandise or
the trades. Then followed the building of an endowment house, where the rites of the church were celebrated; and besides a residence for
the president or chief priest, there was erected a structure known as the Bee-Hive, for the accommodation of Brigham Young’s harem, also
an assembly hall, and lastly a Grand Temple, costing nearly $3,000,000, which, after twenty years, is just now approaching completion.</p>

<p>BEE-HIVE HOUSE, SALT LAKE CITY.</p>

<p class='c011'>The City of Salt Lake, with
a population of 44,000, is about
seven miles from the southeastern
shore of the lake, is beautifully
laid out with streets 132
feet wide, the gutters of which
are kept clean by the constant
running of pure water through
them, brought down from the
Wasatch range and conducted
thence through a myriad of
ditches to irrigate the soil.</p>

<p class='c011'>Salt Lake City is one of the
chief military posts of the
United States, and Fort Douglas,
situated about five miles
from the city, on a gently sloping
hillside at the termination
of Red Butte Cañon, is a delightful
place and commands an
unobstructed view of the entire
valley. A mile toward the
south is Emigrant Cañon, from
which point it is said the Mormon
pioneers first caught sight
of the verdureless plain which they were destined to convert into a very Eden of productiveness. One of the greatest attractions in the
neighborhood of the city (about eighteen miles distant) is a noted bathing resort called Garfield Beach which, during the summer season,
is visited by thousands of persons who there indulge the incomparable luxury of a bath in the marvelous Dead Sea of America. The
water is so buoyant that those who have not mastered the art of swimming find equal sport with those who are most expert, for they can
lie on the delicious waves and be rocked like a child in its cradle, without putting forth any effort whatever. Just back of Garfield’s Beach
is a great cavern in the Oquirrah Mountain side known as the Giant’s Cave, the entrance to which is some 300 feet above the lake level,
though it is plainly evident that in former years the opening was submerged. When the cave was discovered, in 1860, it was found to
contain several complete human skeletons, recklessly disposed, as though they were the victims of slaughter or starvation. It was a custom
among the Utes to place their dead in caves and in hollows among the rocks, but the irregularity of the positions of the skeletons found in
Giant’s Cave lends plausibility to the belief that the remains are those of a band of Indians who, having taken refuge there, were exterminated
by their more powerful enemies.</p>

<p>BRIGHAM YOUNG’S GRAVE, SALT LAKE CITY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>About forty miles north of Salt Lake City, and on the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad, are two remarkable chasms known
as Echo and Weber Cañons, which are not only sublimely grand by reason of their lofty and often vertical walls, but are also marvelously
curious on account of the weird formations which distinguish them. The first one reached on our trip from Salt Lake was Weber Cañon,
which invites attention and
admiration not so much by
beetling cliffs as by its great
variety of scenery and the
kaleidoscopic changes which
appear at every hundred yards
of advance into it. The cañon
is not always narrow, nor are
the walls invariably high, for
there is a succession of all
kinds of mountain scenery,
including stretches of beautiful
meadow land and fertile fields
wrapped about the feet of giant
peaks; colossal gate-ways leading
into dark defiles; mighty
summits breaking way through
cloudland; slopes covered with
pine and aspen; and ridges
that appear to have been fashioned
by gods of war into towers,
bastions and crenelated
battlements. Weber River has
forged its way through this
chasm, and along its sinuous
and rocky bed the railroad
runs, sometimes cutting under
an overhanging ledge, again almost scraping the sides of the walls that swing so near together, then leaping out of night-infested chasms
into broadening valleys that are green and russet with prolific fruitage. While admiring the peaceful landscape and contemplating the
happy environments that render the valley a place of delightful habitation, our dreamy reflections are suddenly disturbed by a sight of what
seems to have been most appropriately named The Devil’s Slide, a formation whose singularity entitles it to consideration as one of nature’s
marvels. The hill upon the side of which this unique wonder occurs is about 800 feet high, composed of a dark red sandstone, whose face
has been scarred by some internal disturbance that has caused to be cast up from the base two gray parallel walls of white sandstone, which
rise to a varying height of twenty to forty feet above the general surface
of the hill, and are not more than twenty feet apart. This
remarkable slide begins at the summit and continues to the base,
where it is reflected in the clear waters of Weber River, opposite Lost
Creek, producing a vision that is weirdly grotesque and sublimely
curious.</p>

The scene is a grand one as we observe it from the railroad tracks, and to this grandeur there is added a vision of indescribable loveliness when the surrounding country is viewed from the dizzy heights of the castle walls. Such a view is one that never can be forgotten; it impresses itself upon the mind as a permanent and lasting memory.

<p>JOSEPHINE FALLS, BEAR CREEK, UTAH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Echo Cañon,” says an English traveler, “is a superb defile.
It moves along like some majestic poem in a series of incomparable
stanzas. There is nothing like it in the Himalayas that I know of,
nor in the Suliman range. In the Bolan Pass, on the Afghan frontier,
there are intervals of equal sublimity; and even as a whole it may
compare with it. But taken for all in all—its length (some thirty
miles), its astonishing diversity of contour, its beauty as well as its
grandeur—I confess that Echo Cañon is one of the masterpieces of
Nature.”</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the first objects which claims particular attention near
the entrance to the cañon from the west is Pulpit Rock, which is near
the village of Echo. This projection receives its name from its suggestive
appearance as well as from the popular tradition that Brigham
Young occupied it to preach his first sermon in Utah. The rocks and
precipices which line the way are variegated with subdued tints,
heightened by the pronounced coloring of the mountain vegetation that
covers the slopes and spreads out in occasional level tracts at the base.
Remarkable and often fantastic formations diversify the cañon, which
for their fancied resemblance to artificial things have received such
appellations as Steamboat Rock, Gibraltar, Monument Rock, etc. Our
further advance brings into view towering cliffs that seem to be suspended
from the sky, and again the walls reach over the way like
mighty claws, and exhibit their serrated peaks in a series of ruins that
in the distance conjure the imagination and present a vision of monoliths,
temples, galleries and castles, such as bestrew the old world.
Hanging Rock and Castle Rock are two specially bold promontories
that give suggestion of Nilotic and Rhenish ruins, a verisimilitude
that is intensified by the knowledge that when Johnston invaded Utah
in 1857 the Mormons fortified many of the cliffs of both Weber and
Echo Cañons, the fading wrecks of these structures being still visible.</p>

<p>PULPIT ROCK, WEBER CAÑON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Church Buttes and The Witches present a strange conglomeration
in uniting religion with superstition, for they appeal to the two
strongest attributes of human nature. From the west the “Witches”
first come into view, a group of fantastically-wrought images that
appear like chaotic creations, the rock-carved dreams of distempered boyhood, the feverish personations of old Granny Bunch’s tales.
There they stand, like an assemblage of weazened and wrinkled wizards plotting some scheme of diabolism, though everlastingly anchored
to the eternal hillsides, where, like Giant Grim, they can do nothing more than make faces at passers-by.</p>

<p class='c011'>Church Buttes are more harmonious in their outlines, as well as massive in their proportions, simulating as they do cathedrals and
meeting houses, some with towers and spires, and others of less ostentatious architecture, but all bearing some intimation of a worshipful
purpose. But these curious efforts of nature are not confined to the cañons named, nor a limited district, for directly north of Green River,
and reached by a Government trail leading to Yellowstone Park, are what are known as the Bridges and Washakie Basins of Bad Lands, a
region that is remarkable for
its capricious formations, the
results of upheavals, glacial
scouring, and erosions by wind
and water. This district of
marvelous forms is a part of
Fremont county, covering an
area of twenty by twenty-five
miles. The country is a mixture
of limestones, shales and
calcareous sandstones, with
occasional green clays, marls,
and whitish sand, the latter
often drifting into long dunes.
Towards the south end of this
dry valley there is a chain of
bluff escarpments, extending
about fourteen miles, and it is
in these escarpments that the
most remarkable examples of
Bad Land erosions are to be
found. The ridges rise 300
feet above the valley and present
a series of abrupt, nearly
vertical faces, worn into innumerable
architectural forms,
with detached pillars standing like monoliths some distance from the walls. Along the dry ravines the same curiously picturesque forms
occur, so that a view of the whole front of the escarpment, with its salient angles, bears a striking resemblance to the ruins of a fortified
city. Enormous masses project from the main wall, the stratifications of cream, gray and green sands are traced across their nearly vertical
fronts like courses of immense masonry, and every face is scoured by innumerable narrow, sharp cuts, which are worn into the soft material
from top to bottom of the cliff, offering narrow galleries which give access for a considerable distance into this labyrinth of natural
fortresses. At a little distance, these sharp incisions seem like the spaces between series of pillars, and the whole aspect of the region is
that of a line of Egyptian structures. Among the most interesting bodies are those of the detached outliers, points of spurs, or isolated
hills, which are mere relics of the beds that formerly covered the whole valley. These monoliths, often reaching 100 feet in height, rise
out of the smooth surface of a level plain of clay, and are sculptured into the most surprising forms, surmounted by domes and ornamented
by many buttresses and jutting pinnacles.</p>

<p>OLDEST HOUSE IN SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH.—<span class="multicaption">Whether or not this is actually the oldest house in Salt Lake City might be a disputed question, for when it comes to ancient things, or to the oldest inhabitant, we generally find that there are several claimants for the honor. But we can say with sincerity and truth that this is one of the oldest representative houses of the Mormon capital. It is one of the better class, erected immediately after the city was laid out, and it has been occupied continuously ever since. The house and its surroundings have an air of quiet restfulness that is exceedingly inviting, and a tired man could sleep like a new-born infant under the board roof with the rain pattering down upon it.</span></p>

<p>WITCH ROCKS, WEBER CAÑON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Clarence King, U. S. Geologist, in a monograph on the Bad Lands, says: “It is not altogether easy to account for the peculiar
character of this erosion, resulting as it does in such singular vertical faces and spire-like forms. A glance at the front of these Bad Lands
shows at once that very much of the resultant forms must be the effect of rain and wind-storms. The small streams which cut down across
the escarpment from the interior of the plateau, do the work of severing the front into detached blocks; but the final forms of these blocks
themselves are probably in
great measure given by the
effect of rain and wind erosion.
The material is so exceedingly
fine, that under the influence of
trickling waters it cuts down
most easily in vertical lines.
A semi-detached block, separated
by two lateral ravines,
becomes quickly carved into
spires and domes, which soon
crumble down to the level of
the plain. It seems probable
that some of the most interesting
forms are brought out by a
slightly harder stratum near the
top of the cliffs (like the
strange, and often uncouth, examples
in Monument Park,
Colorado), which acts in a
measure as a protector of the
softer materials, and prevents
them from taking the mound-forms
that occur when the beds
are of equal hardness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As we follow down Green
River, the same effects are
observable in the vertical bluffs which extend along the shores, images to which fancy has given such names as the Devil’s Tea-pot, the
Giant’s Club, Vermilion Cliffs, and many others, for the geologic structure is the same through nearly the whole of southeast Wyoming.
But the so-called Bad Lands are not wholly confined to Wyoming, for they are met with in both North and South Dakota, west of the
Missouri River; though for beauty and magnitude, those of Wyoming are incomparable.</p>

We presume from the name that it was also the appointed place for the payment of tithes by his devoted followers, and if this is true we can safely estimate that many millions of dollars were carried through its gates and deposited in the coffers of the Church as a tribute from ignorance and superstition to the superiority of cunning and avarice.

<p>HANGING ROCK, AMERICAN FORK CAÑON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From Green River Station we doubled our track and returned to Ogden, where we took some very beautiful views of Ogden Cañon,
the Narrows, Adam’s Falls, and the mountains that soar very far skyward at the city’s rear. But our stay here was limited to two days,
when we took the Oregon branch
of the Union Pacific for a visit to
Shoshone Falls, on Snake River,
which for size as well as magnificence
takes a position second
only to our world-wonderful
Niagara.</p>

<p class='c011'>Directly after leaving Ogden
the road enters the valley of Bear
River, which it follows as far
north as Weston Falls, a distance
of about seventy-five miles. The
scenery along this part of the
route is almost as rugged as that
of Weber Cañon, being a succession
of cañons and lovely
stretches of level lands brought
into the highest state of cultivation
by Mormon industry. At
Pocatello the road branches, one
of its iron arms extending northward
to Helena, while the main
line turns westwardly to Oregon.
The district which it penetrates
after leaving Pocatello is desert-like
and devoid of interest almost
to the western limits of Idaho, if
we except the point where the
road crosses Snake River. Here
the American Falls go brawling
and boiling over immense basaltic
rocks that are struggling with
the impetuous stream, and whose
tops are flecked with tufts of
foam thrown up by mad-dashing
waves. But the waters have not
yet worn a chasm through the
desert, which spreads away on
either side a level plain, until
forty-four miles distant the dreary
monotony is broken by three buttes that rise into view out of the uninviting landscape. We now enter a region that is somber beyond all
power to describe; a wretched desolation that is relieved by no vegetation save of sage-brush, which straggles through little rifts in the
earth and barely lifts its head above the surface. These are the lava beds that extend from Beaver Cañon all along the north side of Snake
River, until they lose themselves in the stream where it turns due north and draws a boundary line between Idaho and Oregon. The land
appears to have been cursed with such a fire as destroyed Gomorrah, for the eye wanders over nothing but the fiery sputa of volcanoes, that,
having wrought the fullest destruction, were in turn destroyed. Everywhere we look there greets our vision waves of lava that lashed the
earth until, tired of their devastating work, they became congealed, or were arrested by the hand of omnipotence. But between the knolls of
scoria are occasional depressions, which
are cross-seamed and cracked until in
many places the fissures are hundreds of
feet deep, apparently extending in depth
to the very vitals of the earth. Some
of the crevices are only a few inches in
width, while there are others several feet
broad, into which creeks have lost themselves,
and lead into bottomless pits.</p>

<p>THE DEVIL’S SLIDE, WEBER CAÑON.—<span class="multicaption">This great natural curiosity is in Weber Cañon, about forty miles north of Salt Lake City. It is composed of two parallel walls of white sandstone, thrown up by some ancient convulsion of the earth, which stand out in bold contrast with the dark red sandstone of the hill. The “Slide” is nearly 800 feet in length, the walls rising to a varying height of twenty to forty feet above the general surface of the hill. A few feet to the left of the “Slide” there is another wall of similar formation, but almost covered by the accumulated washings of centuries. It is a pity that so remarkable a curiosity should have received so profane an appellation; but we presume there would be no regrets if the devil should be required to take a hasty run down the top of the ragged and jutting walls of his famous slide.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>It is a little more than one hundred
miles from Pocatello to Shoshone Station,
at which point we left the train,
and by private conveyance struck across
the lava fields, a distance of twenty-five
miles due south, over the dustiest wagon-road
that mortal ever traveled. The
way is like a switch-back, up and down
over sharp waves of lava, with desolation
and discomfort obtrusive companions,
and nothing rising above the dull
undulations except a purplish tint in the
horizon, marking with faint intimation
a range of mountains one hundred miles
away in Utah. For more than four hours
we traversed this wearying stretch of
parched and begrimed desert, without a
sign of the river, until at length turning
the base of a higher ridge we came suddenly upon the brink of a tremendous chasm, and there, 1,200 feet below our feet, was the river
which we had journeyed so far to view. Long before reaching this objective point, we had heard a deep, rumbling noise that seemed to
emanate from the earth’s internals, but now, with astounded sense of the awful, we beheld the cause. There before us was the vexed
waters of a large river pouring over two precipices, the first 82 feet and the second 210 feet high, producing by the final plunge a colossal
caldron, from which the mists rose up in boiling clouds that ever and anon hid the falls from sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>A glance at this tremendous waterfall more than compensated for all the annoyances and discomforts that we had endured. It was a
scene of positively bewildering majesty; a vision of the incomparably
grand; an object lesson teaching the mightiness and mysterious ways of
God. In the deep diapason of its voice we recognized nature’s hallelujah,
and the thunderous boom of its plungings was like a chorus of
invocation welling from a million throats. Its lovely grandeur, bursting
out of the heart of desolation, is the personification of powerful,
awe-inspiring sublimity, an exaltation of deity, an inspiration to the
soul, a very glorification and apotheosis of nature.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pausing on the bank to contemplate and measure the colossal
wonder of the falls, we saw the emerald stream gliding along as placidly
as though its mission was one of peace; nor was there any appearance
of danger to the ferryman, who operated his boat by an over-head wire
cable stretched from bank to bank, only 200 yards above. The quiet
flow, however, was better understood when we learned that the river
here is 200 feet deep; a very ocean filling a mighty chasm; an inundated
cañon whose volume of water equals that of a dozen Niagaras,
for this tremendous gorge extends a distance of eighteen miles, and its
bottom lies under the river 1,400 feet below the brink.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shoshone Falls proper are 950 feet wide at the point of precipitation,
but only a few yards to the rear of it are Bridal Veil Falls, whose
width is 125 feet, and
which constitute the
first plunge or precipice,
which in turn is broken
into a series of minor
cascades, known as Bridal
Train and Natural
Mill Race Falls, the divisions
being produced
by the interposition of
Eagle Rock and Bell’s
Island. One mile and
a half below the cataract
are Cascade Falls, while
three miles above are
Twin Falls, which leap
down a height of 180
feet, thus showing that
there is a space of nearly
five miles in which the
tremendous chasm has been torn by convulsions which most probably occurred after the river was turned into its bed. An exquisite
word-painting by the journalistic pen of Hon. C. C. Goodwin is here reproduced:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The lava beds of Idaho are a marked feature of that Territory. Starting near the eastern boundary, they extend southwesterly
for a long distance, and are from 300 feet to 900 feet in depth. This mass was once a river of molten fire, the making of which must
have succeeded a convulsion of nature more terrible than any ever witnessed by mortals, and long years must have passed before the awful
fiery mass was cooled. To the east of the source of the lava flow, the Snake River bursts out of the hills, becoming almost at once a
sovereign river, and flowing at first southwesterly and then bending westerly, cuts through the lava fields nearly in the center of the
Territory, reckoned from east to west, and about forty miles north of its southern border, and thence flowing with great curves, merges
finally with the Columbia. The two rivers combined make one of the chief waterways of the continent, and here and there take on pictures
of great beauty. Never anywhere else was
there such a scene; never anywhere else
was so beautiful a picture hung in so rude
a frame; never anywhere else, on a background
so forbidding and weird, were so
many glories clustered. Around and beyond,
there is nothing but the desert—sere,
silent, lifeless—as though Desolation
had builded there everlasting thrones to
Sorrow and Despair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Away back in remote ages, over
the withered breast of the desert, a river of
fire, 100 miles wide and 400 miles long,
was turned. As the fiery mass cooled, its
red waves became transfixed, and turned
black, giving to the double-desert an indescribably
blasted and forbidding face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But while this river of fire was in
flow, a river of water was fighting its way
across it, or has since made war and forged
out for itself a channel through the mass.
This channel looks like the grave of a volcano
that had been robbed of its dead. But
right between its crumbling and repellent walls, transfiguration appears. And such a picture! A river as lordly as the Hudson or Ohio,
springing from the distant snow-crested Tetons, with waters transparent as glass, but green as emerald, with majestic flow and ever-increasing
volume, sweeps on until it reaches this point where the display begins.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Suddenly, in different places in the river-bed, jagged rocky reefs are upheaved, dividing the current into four rivers, and these, in
a mighty plunge of eighty feet downward, dash on their way. Of course the waters are churned into foam, and roll over the precipice
white as are the garments of the morning when no cloud obscures the sun. The loveliest of these falls is called “The Bridal Veil,”
because it is made of the lace which is woven with a warp of falling waters and a woof of sunlight. Above this and near the right bank,
is a long trail of foam, and this is called “The Bridal Trail.” The other channels are not so fair as the one called “The Bridal Veil,”
but they are more fierce and wild, and carry
in their ferocious sweep more power.</p>

The greater splendor succeeds. With
swifter flow, the startled waters dash on,
and within a few feet take their second
plunge into a solid crescent, over a sheer
precipice, 210 feet to the abyss below. On
the brink there is a rolling crest of white,
dotted here and there, in sharp contrast,

Finally, through the long, unclouded days,
the sun sends down his beams, and to give
the startling scene its growing splendor,
wreathes the terror and the glory in a rainbow
halo. On either sullen bank the
extremities of its arc are anchored, and
there in its many-colored robes of light it
lies outstretched above the abyss like
wreaths of flowers above a sepulchre. Up

that then omnipotence was

<p>NATURAL BRIDGE, SHOSHONE FALLS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“There is nothing elsewhere like it, nothing half so weird, so beautiful, so clothed in majesty, so draped with terror; nothing else
that awakens impressions at once so startling, so winsome, so profound. While journeying through the desert, to come suddenly upon it,
the spectacle gives one something of the emotions that would be experienced in beholding a resurrection from the dead. In the midst of what
seems like a dead world, suddenly there springs into irrepressible life something so marvelous, so grand, so caparisoned with loveliness and
irresistible might, that the head is bowed, the strained heart throbs tumultuously, and the awed soul sinks to its knees.” The time is fast
approaching when the sublime glories of Shoshone Falls will be appreciated by tourists, and by that large class of summer vacationists who
are always searching for sights and places that will drive away the <i>ennui</i>
from which they chiefly suffer. The beat of ocean billow, the roar of
waterfall, the stretch of landscape from lofty mountain peak, the lonely
quietude of glen and wilderness, each have their votaries; but about Shoshone’s
chasm there is more to charm than all of these, for the very desolation
of its environments adds fascination to the wild and tameless scenery of
the falls. The poet and the painter find here an inspiration for their
genius; while the most prosaic spectator is thrilled by the matchless
grandeur, the majestic awfulness of a mad-cantering river plunging through
a gigantic rent, and over a precipice so high that the waters are scattered
into mist and dissolve in rainbows when they meet the seething caldron
below. It is a strange exhibition of nature’s power and freakishness, a
manifestation of mysterious force, a blending of results precipitated by
vomiting volcano and an irresistible flood of waters, the joining of rivers
of fire with streams breaking over the barriers of mountains and pouring
down upon the plains.
Considering the surroundings,
the bleak sterility of
what appears to be a boundless
extent of lava fields, and
the mighty, awe-compelling
avalanche of waters that
cleaves it, Shoshone Falls
is perhaps the most remarkable
waterfall to be found
anywhere on either continent,
a wonder in which
Snake River has an almost
equal part. Indeed, this
extraordinary river exhibits
many equally astonishing
features along its extreme
length, for while a greater
part of the stream flows
through a belt of scoria, the
lower portion is a succession
of waterfalls, second only to
those of Shoshone.</p>

Having satisfied our curiosity and embalmed the views of Shoshone Falls, as here presented, our party of photographers and
historiographer returned to Colorado over the same route that we had come, but at Grand Junction we proceeded southward over
the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad to Gunnison, Ouray and Tulleride. At Grand Junction, Grand River divides, the southern
branch of which is called Gunnison River, and takes its rise in the Sagauche and Elk ranges; and it was along the valley of this
south branch that our route lay. It is characteristic of Colorado rivers that all of them flow through large fissures, and a majority
have cleft the mountains into mighty chasms, thus producing the matchless scenery which has helped so much to make the State
famous. It fortunately happens that the most picturesque places in the west are either directly upon the lines or in the near vicinity of
railroads, for necessity has compelled their
construction along the river valleys, since
there are few other passes in the mountains,
and no other routes so feasible.</p>

<p>TOADSTOOL ROCK, NEAR GUNNISON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The scenery along the south branch
of Grand River is very similar to that
which we have described on the main
stream, and leaving Grand Junction we
almost immediately entered the Unaweep
Cañon, thence in succession Puniweep and
Escalante. The road leaves the valley of
the main stream at Delta, and follows a
smaller branch (Cedar River) a distance
of fifty or sixty miles, until Cimarron is
reached, below the southern terminus of
the Mesa Verde. In this interval, and running
along the north side of the Mesa
Verde—Green Plateau—is the Grand Cañon
of the Gunnison, a cleft in the earth that
is magnificently imposing, possessing as it
does many of the characteristics of Grand
River, though the walls are of limestone
and hence not so precipitous, as being
more easily eroded than granite, the base of the walls are cut until in many places they shelve far over the stream, while at frequent
intervals the river is broken by cascades and waterfalls, those of Chippeta being particularly beautiful.</p>

<p>BOX CAÑON FALLS, NEAR GUNNISON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Black Cañon, which begins near the town of Cimarron, is another wild gorge, through which the river glides with stately and
uninterrupted majesty, a deep crystalline stream, until it passes Currecanti Needle, when the smooth flow is interrupted by bowlders which
convert it into a rapid. Currecanti Needle is an object which excites the almost reverent wonder of every beholder. It is a symmetrical
cone of red basalt, resting its feet in the Gunnison
River and shooting up to an amazing
height, its summit terminating in a spire that
pierces the clouds, while its body is as variegated
with bright colors as was Joseph’s coat.
On each side of the stream the bluffs reach up
2,000 feet, but the needle soars very much
more loftily, a great sachem among the stone
giants that stand in colossal files along the
river. Near Sapinero, which is at the eastern
end of the cañon, the walls draw so near
together that the light of day is almost entirely
excluded, but at places where the sun is admitted
they sparkle with dazzling lustre,
caused by reflections from the mica of which
they are largely composed.</p>

<p>EAGLE ROCK, SHOSHONE FALLS.—<span class="multicaption">The photograph on page 111 gives us a fine front view of Shoshone Falls, while on this page we see them from the side and just above the final plunge. The principal attraction in this picture is Eagle Rock, which occupies a prominent position in the foreground. On the top of the rock there is an eagle’s nest, from which many a young brood has taken its flight, for from all the indications the nest has been in existence for centuries. It is a fitting place for the fearless bird of freedom to rear its young, safe from the raids of wild animals and on the very brink of the dashing and roaring waters. Nothing but an eagle would dare approach such a place.</span></p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>PROFILE ROCK, NEAR OURAY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From Gunnison the road follows
Tomachi Creek eastward, passing over a country
devoid of particular interest, except as
views are afforded of high mountains in the
Fossil Ridge, Sagauche and Sangre de Cristo
ranges far away, until the ascent of Marshall’s
Pass is begun. The road now rises rapidly
until it crosses the Rocky Mountains, at an
elevation of 11,000 feet. But the ascent is
indirect, in a serpentine course close to the
cone of Mount Ouray, which penetrates the
depths of heaven, to a height of 14,000 feet;
so lofty that the sun shines brightly upon its
snow-covered summit, while the earth below is
wrapped in the sable garments of deepest night.
Round and round, but in an ascending circle,
the laboring train makes its toilsome way, until
we see the tracks below us looking like a succession
of terraces. At the apex we run through
a long tunnel of snow-sheds, through openings
in which a view may be had of the extinct
crater of Ouray, while a hundred miles away
towards the south, and across a wide expanse
of plain, the frosted ridge of Sangre de Cristo
is clearly visible through the tenuous air. The ride over this great mountain is one of the most delightful and picturesque in all the world,
and leaves an impression which is as charming and fadeless as the memory of a boy’s first triumph. After passing down the mountain
side, a short run brings us to Poncha Junction, at the entrance of the Valley
of the Arkansas, and a few miles further Salida is reached, a splendid
little town that is begirt with mountains, but reposes like a jewel in a green
sea of amazing fertility and beauty. As we rush eastward down this lovely
valley, some wondrous sights are viewable from our car. On the right the
Arkansas River bowls along close by the track, while far beyond the
horizon is belted with the Sangre de Cristo range. On our left our eyes
are gladdened with the sight of three bristling peaks, known as Harvard,
Princeton and Yale, which rise above their more humble brothers in the
Park range. The scene now undergoes a quick change, for the valley becomes
rapidly narrowed by the mountains drawing together, as if to bar our passage;
but as their seared sides and snowy crests become more distinct by a
closer approach, the scenery increases in interest until soon it develops into
positive grandeur. At Parkdale we observe that the sloping sides of the
mountains are becoming more abrupt and rocky, until five miles beyond,
the gigantic, the marvelous and the terror-inspiring Royal Gorge bursts
full upon our amazed and startled senses. The colossal peak has been
cut in twain; sliced by the persistent waters of the Arkansas, that with
remorseless jaws have eaten through the heart of the giant mountain that
lay down in its way; and there the great gash breaks before us, into which
the ravening river rushes, with a growling voice and imperious dash, as
reckless as a bandit, and impetuous as a fiery youth. Pines and aspens
struggle up the mountain sides, but where the waters have split a way
there is nothing save vertical walls of stone that soar up, up, so high that
it wearies the sight to travel to their summits. There are seams and
depressions in their awful cliffs, and projections and cavities that show
imprints of the teeth of frost, and away up on these eagles have found
resting places, and built their eyries where only the storm-god can reach
them. Distance, as expressed in feet on paper, conveys scarcely an idea of
mountain height or cañon depth, for the awesome presence is lacking. But
the height of the walls of the Royal Gorge, or, as it is sometimes called,
the Grand Cañon of the Arkansas, is 3,000 feet, or more than half a mile,
while the chasm is only fifty feet wide where the river rushes through, and
but seventy feet at the summit. Three Eiffel towers, set upon top of each
other, would hardly reach the crown of these tremendous cliffs, around the
crests of which flying eagles look like flies lazily swimming in a haze of
distance. In order to avoid cutting a road-bed through the base of the perpendicular
cliffs, which come very close together, an iron bridge has been
thrown around the defile and suspended by anchoring its sides in the
granite walls, so that it has no pillared supports, for none are needed.
Upon this suspended bridge, which runs parallel with and over the
stream, every passenger train stops for the space of several minutes to
give opportunity for an inspection of the Royal Gorge, which is most
appalling and wonderful at this point.</p>

<p>LEANING TOWER, PERRY PARK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The eastern end of the gorge is at Cañon City, and after leaving
this place the valley widens rapidly and spreads out into an arid plain
that joins the prairies of Kansas. The change from a weirdly wild
and savagely astounding cañon, to the pale landscape of a verdureless
desert, is very sudden, and there is no variation in the passionless
monotony of alkaline plain that lies between the mountain and Pueblo,
a distance of forty miles. The Arkansas loses much of its volume and
activity in struggling through the parched lands, becoming a listless
stream, and murky with sediment that is gathered from its fast-washing
banks.</p>

<p class='c011'>We had to double upon our route very often in order to reach
the numerous points of
interest and charming
scenery which is accessible
by railroad, but in
many cases much time
was saved by dividing
our party, though we refrain
from wearying the
reader with the uninteresting
particulars of
these movements. In
the present instance,
however, two of our
photographers, with the
camera car, proceeded
southwest from Pueblo,
over the Denver &amp; Rio
Grande R. R., to Wagon-Wheel
Gap, while the
others of our party returned,
by way of the
same route we had just
traversed, to Montrose,
thence to Ouray, and from that terminus,
by stage, to Ironton, a distance of seven
miles. From this latter point they followed
the sweep of the same road, called
the Rainbow route, around to Alamoso,
where a junction was made with the two
photographers on their return journey
from Wagon-Wheel Gap.</p>

<p>THE TRAIL ALONG THE BREAST OF SAN JUAN MOUNTAIN.—<span class="multicaption">It appeared to many impossible to connect the towns Ouray and Silverton by stage road, on account of the tumultuous mountains, riven by mighty chasms, and scarred by eroding streams, that lay between; but skill, patience and great expenditure of money accomplished what was undertaken with misgivings. A roadway was blasted and carved along the rocky breast of the peaks; chasms were bridged, rents were filled, and our photograph shows a portion of the result, a wildly picturesque stage road, over which it is a delightful experience to travel.</span></p>

<p>TWIN FALLS, NEAR AMES, COLORADO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The journey south from Montrose
is along Uncompaghre River—every little
stream is called a river in the far west—which,
like many other streams we have
described, has worn a deep bed, in which
it is now confined by high walls of polychromatic
colors, very beautiful to see.
From the occasional rises over which the
road passes, very lovely views are to be
had of Horse-Fly Peak on the west, and
the rather gentle elevation of Tongue
Mesa on the east. At Dallas the scenery
becomes much more rugged, and thence
to Ouray, and Silverton, which is twenty
miles from Ironton, the landscape is
tumultuous; for nature is here in strange
derangement, not to say chaotic dismemberment.
It appeared an impossible feat
to connect Ouray and Ironton by a stage-road,
so tempestuously craggy is the interval,
rent as it is by mighty chasm and
spurred by amazing peaks of stones piled
up into vast pyramids of confusion. But
engineering skill dominated even here,
and not only was a wagon-road cut
through this chain of obstacles, but a
narrow-gauge railroad was successfully
constructed between Ironton and
Silverton.</p>

<p>JAWS OF DEATH, ANIMAS CAÑON.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The approach to Ouray is by a way
impressively magnificent, through rifts in
castellated walls that are rich with the
primary colors, and lofty enough to bathe their
crests in the clouds. There goes the river, like
a belated business man trying to overtake time,
roaring, fretting, panting, with hardly enough
space between the escarpments to admit its
passage. Along, and over and around this
mad-dashing stream the road winds, up and
down, in and out, until the points of the compass
lose their bearings, and swing around in
distraction.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ouray lies at peace with the world, in a
basin whose sides are like a giant’s punch-bowl,
only that the confinement is by a succession
of mountain ranges piling up behind each
other until the highest attain an altitude of
14,235 feet, and hold perpetual carnival with
the snow-storm. That little basin seems to be
the paint-pot of the Titans, and the mountains
their mixing-boards. Letting our sight travel
slowly up the soaring slopes, every step of the
way is one of beauty. Clothed with a luxurious
growth of yellow aspen, the brown of oak,
the deep green of spruce, and the silver sheen
of mountain pine, the picture needs only a
frame to make it perfect. And there above is
the thing desired; for where the timber line
ends, the flaming colors of red, orange, purple,
gray and brown stone begins, rising ever higher
until they fade away behind the mists that
gather about the peaks.</p>

<p class='c011'>As we proceed on the way to Silverton
the road inclines through forests whose autumn
tints keep the eye dancing with admiration,
and having descended two thousand feet, the
mouth of Bear Creek is reached, where it rolls
along a terrible cataract, known as Bear Creek
Cascade. A little further on, we dash out
upon a bridge which spans a dizzy height, for,
there below us, the raging creek plunges over
a precipice 275 feet high, and is dashed into
vapor upon the rocks. It is a startling sight
to behold the surging waters, and watch the
mad plunge that falls into a caldron as angry
as ever witches stretched hands about.</p>

Its peak is more than 14,000 feet above the level of the sea, and there it rests in lofty grandeur, looking down like a white-robed priest upon the little valleys nestling at its feet. It is a beautiful sight to stand at the foot of this mountain and watch a railroad train dashing back and forth, here and there, and zigzagging hither and yonder with no apparent purpose, but always climbing higher and higher, until it goes out of sight behind a ridge or through a tunnel, sending back a white flake of steam as it whistles good-bye. When you go to Colorado don’t fail to visit Ouray.</span></p>

ride, with mountains on either side, by the
Needles, Sultan Peak, silver cascades, until
soon we reach the Valley of the Animas, and
are presently hurled into the wildly weird and
awfully sublime Animas Cañon. A very suggestive
name was given by the early Spaniards
to this stream: Rio de los Animas,
signifying the <i>river of lost souls</i>, for nothing
could be more gruesomely somber. The
cañon proper is about fifteen miles long, and
lies between Rockwood and Durango, and is
a cleavage that separates the San Juan and
San Miguel ranges. The walls
are perpendicular, and the passage
so narrow that the sunlight
can hardly get through. The
railroad runs along the breast
of the solid rock walls, on a
ledge or balcony that had to be
cut in the sheer escarpment,
1,500 feet above the river, but
the top of the frowning enclosure
is still 500 feet higher.
Sitting at the car window, the
traveler looks down into what
appears to be an almost bottomless
gulch, and sees the beating
waters swirling in pools, and
tossing in a terrific tumult that
fills the cañon with deafening
roar. While the river here is
a succession of cataracts, there
are waterfalls on either side,
leaping down from bordering
cliffs and joining hands with
the impetuous river.</p>

The streams from the summit flow eastward into the Atlantic and westward into the Pacific. The tracks are so winding that passengers on ascending trains frequently become puzzled, and imagine that they are moving in a circle without a definite purpose, but when the train reaches the top and dashes over the divide, the object of its devious course is revealed, and a feeling of exhilaration succeeds that of doubt and uncertainty as it darts down the opposite side with the swiftness of an eagle.</span></p>

The region is altogether
one of extraordinary interest
alike for the miner, tourist and

west of the town are the
picturesque ruins of very ancient cliff-dwellers, who, in the early centuries, excavated deep recesses in the perpendicular walls along the
Rio Mancos, and there made their homes. Evidently they were of the same race, and no doubt were contemporary with those who fled from
the Spanish persecutors and took refuge in artificial caves in the Grand Cañon of the Colorado.</p>

encountered by expeditions under Colonel Sumner and General Canby. The region, and particularly De Chelly Cañon, was the stronghold
of the Navajoe Indians, who rendered the defile almost impregnable. Time and again efforts were made by large bodies of troops to force
a passage, but as often they
were driven back by the
Indians hurling stones down
the thousand feet of perpendicular
height. The rear
was likewise protected by
remarkable ruggedness of
the approach, and an army
sent against them was thus
held at bay by the Indians
for several months. Kit
Carson was finally given a
commission as colonel and
sent against the defiant
marauders with a force of
five hundred men. Understanding
all the difficulties
of the situation, he so disposed
his army as to hold
the Indians within their
lines of refuge, and choosing
winter as the best time
for action, laid a siege that
effectually cut off all communication.
Aid from
the outside being thus prevented,
and all supplies shut off, the Navajoes were presently reduced to such straits that after three desperate but futile efforts to escape,
the entire band surrendered.</p>

<p class='c011'>After passing through Animas Cañon, on the eastern journey, the scenery continues impressively beautiful, for several pellucid
streams are crossed at points where they have cut deep furrows in the earth, and eaten their way through opposing mountains. At Ignacio
we met with the first considerable number of Indians seen thus far during our trip. This place is the headquarters of the Southern Utes’
reservation, and was named after their chief. Twenty miles beyond we cross the Rio Piedra and enter the valley of the San Juan, which is
followed for nearly sixty miles, and until Navajo is reached, where another small band of miserable-looking Indians have their quarters,
and besiege incoming passenger trains with importunities that travelers almost invariably generously respond to. Now we are running
along the borders of New Mexico, a line of demarkation indicated by the San Juan range that lies north of us, while southward stretches
away the undulating and arid plains. At Amargo we are met by another band of Indians, whose sullen countenances and bedraggled
appearance plainly show them to be Apaches, whose numbers, however, are now so reduced that the murderous raids which made the tribe
celebrated in the early annals of the far west, are not likely to be repeated again.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many persons have read of mountain trails, but comparatively few have seen them or realized the dangers that attend a passage over them. The splendid photograph
of the trail over San Juan Mountains, on this page, will therefore be a subject of interest to all. This is a picture of the real thing, as it exists in nature.</p>

<p class='c011'>Crevice Cañon, near Ouray, Colo., the companion picture, is another of nature’s wonders that will arouse the curiosity of every reader. It seems impossible that so
small a stream could have carved its way through such an obstacle, but it has left the marks of its power in the granite walls of the opposing mountain.</p>

<p>ANTELOPE PARK, NEAR TOLTEC GORGE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>We cross the Conejos range at Cumbres, at an elevation of 10,000 feet, and after traversing a lower range of the San Juan we again strike
the Los Pinos River, and, taking a turn around Prospect Peak, come in view of Toltec Gorge, one of the most fearfully grand cañons in the
world. The mountain is pierced by a tunnel near its summit, which is approached by a balcony trestle, on which the east-bound train stops
several minutes to permit the passengers
to gaze into the dreadful depths of
the chasm over which they hang. For
it must be understood that the road-bed
is built here upon a trestle that has
all its fastenings in the perpendicular
walls, and without any support beneath,
so that to one looking from the
car window the train appears to be
suspended in mid-air, 1,000 feet above
the rolling waters below.</p>

<p class='c011'>The gorge is 1,200 feet deep,
and besides being narrow, the walls
are perpendicular, so that daylight
tarries but a short while in its profound
recesses. As we pass the Toltec
Gorge, Phantom Curve is approached,
and from the grandeur and awesomeness
with which the great abyss impressed
us, our interest is quickened
and spell-bound by objects that at once
excite wonder and curious amazement.
We are suddenly introduced to forms
more strange than monstrous, more
remarkable for their incongruity than
significant for their grandeur. The chisels of nature’s sculptors, frost, water, storms, ice and decay have wrought many astounding things
in stone, which rival in grotesque eccentricity the queer figures that render famous the Garden of the Gods. Passing this parade-ground of
nature’s idols, we strike the Big Horn Curve, and twist like a contortionist in making a devious descent, that winds and winds until at last
we reach the feet of the Sangre de Cristo range, at Antonito. Thence our direction was due north, over a level country, until we reached
Alamosa, where, as per arrangement, we met the others of our party on their return from Wagon-Wheel Gap. Here we received reports
of the trip from Pueblo, and tarried a while to write up our journals, pack our negatives, and prepare for the journey that by a long sweep
was to take us to the lands of the Pacific.</p>

<p class='c011'>All over the central and western portion of Colorado we find a succession of beautiful and magnificent scenery, mountains, waterfalls, cañons, landscapes of surpassing
loveliness, and everything to charm the eye and please the most diversified taste. The region about Ouray is one of the most picturesque in the entire State. The mines
are among the richest in Colorado; and the hot springs, added to its other attractions, make this locality a famous resort. A good idea of the grandeur of the scenery is

<p>LAKE BRENNAN, IN SOUTH PARK, NEAR PLATTE CAÑON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The trip southward from Pueblo possesses comparatively little interest until Cuchara Junction is reached, where one branch of the
Denver and Rio Grande Railroad starts directly west, while the other continues south to Trinidad, and there forms a junction with the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad.</p>

<p class='c011'>At Cuchara the scenery changes from waste plains to a tumultuary landscape similar to sections which we have just described. The
road follows the valley of Cuchara for a distance of twenty miles, and then begins a rapid ascent towards Veta Pass, which is, in some
respects, more wonderful than even Marshall Pass. In one place the grade is 216 feet to the mile, so steep that two locomotives are
required to haul even light trains, and so serpentine that to passengers the cars appear to be moving in a circle. When the summit is
reached, an altitude of 9,400
feet above sea level has been
gained, and there is a panorama
presented that it seems
almost sacrilegious to attempt
to describe. Away to the
south rises up, like monsters
plucking stars from the sky,
the Spanish Peaks, whose
frosted heads are often hidden
by clouds that gather about
them; towards the west, dim
with distance, is seen the
commanding form of Sierra
Blanca, whose crown is the
very heavens; and northward,
La Veta Mountain,
stupendous and sublime,
stands like a grizzly sentinel,
surveying the lesser wonders
of nature and protecting
them against the fierce
storms that beat the bronzed
breasts of the Rockies. Muleshoe
Curve, over which we
made the approach up Dump
Mountain, is plainly visible,
as are the numerous tracks that gridiron the slopes, and the waterfalls that play hide and seek along the mountain sides. Looking down
we see the fast-receding banks and almost perpendicular cliffs, and the giant bowlders that have been hurled from the summit into the
abyssmal depths a mile below, gathered into dams to impede the flow of waters. The view towards the east is unbroken, and there,
spreading out like the lap of bounty, we watch the green prairie running away from the mountain base to meet the horizon.</p>

<p>CITY OF OURAY, AND OURAY MOUNTAINS, COL.—<span class="multicaption">If one should search the world over he could hardly find a more picturesque location for a city than this. It is a perfect picture, with framework of snow-covered mountains, and the music of dashing streams and laughing waterfalls. The city of Ouray has a population of about 3000, and was an active business centre previous to the depressing times in mining interests. It is still a resort for health seekers and tourists, and must always remain so on account of the excellent medicinal properties of its hot springs and the splendor and beauty of its surrounding scenery. The city nestles in a cozy valley at the foot of the mountain, down the sides of which races the little stream that breaks into such a splendid waterfall near the base, as seen in the background of the photograph.</span></p>

<p>MAIDEN HAIR FALLS, NEAR DUMP MOUNTAIN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Crossing La Veta’s lofty pass, the descent is rapid and tortuous, until a level is reached in the San Luis Park, which is abloom
with the glories of cultivated fields, and animate with grazing herds. This great park, that covers an area equal to the State of
Connecticut, was, in the early years of the world’s life, a vast inland sea,
though its elevation is now more than 7,000 feet. The earth has absorbed
nearly all its waters, though San Luis Lake still lies near its center, shining
like a sheet of silver, and is fed by thirty mountain streams. All around
this lake, whose length is sixty miles, is a waving savanna of luxuriant
grasses, which form the frame of as pretty a picture as the eye of man ever
wandered over.</p>

<p class='c011'>As we proceed westward from La Veta Pass, the landscape becomes
somewhat tame, though when we reach Fort Garland the grandest view is
obtainable of Sierra Blanca Mountain, whose peak is at an elevation of
14,500 feet, the second highest in America. We cross San Luis Park, and
having again reached Alamosa, continue on towards Wagon-Wheel Gap, by
way of the picturesque valley of the Rio Grande del Norte. Though
while en route we pass through no wonderful cañons, the way is full of
interest and beautiful scenery. The river, in places, spreads out into a
noiseless and sluggish stream, while again it is contracted by narrow walls
into cascades and roaring waterfalls of exceeding magnificence. Especially
is this true when we draw near to Wagon-Wheel Gap, where the walls are
not only narrow, but rise into palisades of great height and beauty, and at
one place, for the distance of half a mile, there are cliffs that soar skyward
and lean towards the river, making a rocky canopy above the roadway that
hugs the rushing stream.</p>

<p class='c011'>We are now in the famous Creede mining region, where, besides
silver to lure the avaricious seeker of riches, there is much to excite the
admiration of the tourist and lover of nature. La Gorita Mountains lie
towards the north in vast banks of haze, and the southern horizon is broken
by the San Juan range. Here, also, is a region of surprising springs, where
boiling-hot and ice-cold waters gush out of neighboring hills, and in places
actually strike hands to neutralize each other. Creede, which is ten miles
from Wagon-Wheel Gap, is a typical mining camp, full of excitement
and all the concomitants of a new and rich discovery, though it is
rapidly acquiring civilized ways. Willow Gulch is the scene of greatest
activity, and there is now to be obtained, for a fair equivalent, everything
from bad fighting whiskey to a spring bed, though the latter is still a scarce
luxury, particularly in the immediate vicinity of Willow Gulch.</p>

<p>ANIMAS CAÑON.—<span class="multicaption">Animas Cañon is on the Silverton branch of the Denver and Rio Grande Railway, just beyond the station of Rockwood and about 470 miles from Denver. The gorge is formed by the breaking through the mountains of the Rio de las Animas Perdidas, or River of Lost Souls, as it is appropriately termed in musical Spanish. The railroad tracks are laid along a shelf cut in the solid rock wall of the cañon, 500 feet below the top of the mountain and 1000 above its foot. The grandeur of the scene may be inferred from this description. It requires a steady nerve or long practice in traveling over such places to enable one to look down this frightful precipice from the car windows, and it is no unusual thing to observe timid tourists hugging the inner side of the coaches as they dash by this dangerous spot.</span></p>

<p>CLIFF DWELLINGS IN THE RIO MANCOS CAÑON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>After our meeting and short stay at Alamosa, our party again divided,
two of our photographers going south from that point, over the New Mexico
extension of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad, to Santa Fe, while the
other proceeded east to Cuchara Junction, thence south to Trinidad, and
from that place he went by way of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
Railroad, to Santa Fe, where our party
again united.</p>

<p class='c011'>The route directly south from Alamosa
is across a well-watered country, but
there is nothing of particular interest in
the way of scenery until the town of
Barranca is reached, where the road strikes
the Rio Grande. Out of a level plain the
train now dashes into deep gorges, and
winds along the banks of a stream that is
justly celebrated for the wild and rugged
pageantry of mountains which it pierces.
Comanche Cañon bursts into view, a glorious
revelation of chaos, whose cliffs of
marl and basaltic rock have tried in vain
to arrest the energy and daunt the skill of
civil engineers. As a consequence, their
sides are rent and bored into cuts and tunnels,
until the mountains of stone are made
to acknowledge man’s sovereignty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fifteen miles south of Barranca is
Espanola, a quaint old Spanish town,
whose chief interest, however, lies in the
fact that it is the nearest railroad point to
some of the most interesting pueblos and
cliff ruins that are to be found in New
Mexico. The Indian adobes in this
vicinity, which claim the largest attention
of the anthropologist, are those of San
Juan, Santa Clara and San Idelfonso, all
situated within three or four miles of
Espanola. At Santa Clara are also the
ruins of cliff dwellings, relics of the habitations
of a race that exists no longer, save
in uncertain traditions.</p>

Black Cañon is so called because at places the walls run up vertically and almost touch their heads, so nearly excluding the sunlight that the gorge is quite dark even at noonday, inexpressibly sombre when the sky is overcast, and weirdly awful when storms break, or night shrouds it with a pall. Photographs cannot be satisfactorily made of the dark places in the cañon, and the view herewith accordingly pictures the end near Cimmaron Station.</span></p>

<p>WEAPONS AND UTENSILS OF THE CLIFF-DWELLERS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The little knowledge that we have
respecting these ancient people is derived
from the investigations of the late James
Stevenson, chief of the Hayden Survey,
who explored the cliff and cave dwellings
of Arizona and New Mexico. His labors were rewarded also by the discovery of two perfect skeletons, in the Cañon de Chelly, which
proved to be those of prehistoric inhabitants. He also, by patient study, obtained a very thorough knowledge of the religious mythology
of the Zunis, and secured a complete collection of their fetich-gods, besides familiarizing himself with the manners and beliefs of the
Navajoes and Moquis. We hold him in remembrance for his pioneer as well as scientific services. It was Stevenson that made the first
survey of Yellowstone Park, who traced the Columbia and Snake Rivers to their sources, and who was the first white man to climb the
Great Tetons, in Wyoming, and reach the Indians’ sacred altar, which has been kept inviolate for centuries.</p>

<p class='c011'>The six ancient pueblos, which are still inhabited by Indians, were discovered by the Spaniards only forty-eight years after Columbus
first landed on San Salvador, and they
are thus entitled to rank among the
earliest discoveries of this character
ever made. In the neighboring cliffs
are numerous cave dwellings equally
prehistoric in their origin, but which
Mr. Stevenson explored with the
most valuable results, enabling him to
determine the habits and peculiarities
of these archaic people. On the west
side of the road, and bounded by
Caliente Creek, is the black Mesa, a
curious elevation that might once have
been an island in the ocean that
covered this region when the world
was young. Towards the east, and
in bold view, is the Taos range, which
merges into the Culebra range further
north, and thence into the Sangre de
Cristo. Between the railroad and the
Taos Mountain, lies the town of Taos,
in a beautiful valley, watered by
branches of the Rio Grande. It is a
quaint old place, composed chiefly of
two great adobe buildings five stories
high, surrounded by prosperous
ranches and crumbling pueblos, and
is celebrated as having been the home of Kit Carson, and the place where his body reposes. His grave is marked by an imposing monument
erected to his memory, as a mark of gratitude for his intrepid services, by citizens of New Mexico. The place is accordingly
something of a shrine, but is not much visited, because it is about twenty-five miles from the railroad, except on the 30th of September of
each year, when it is the scene of a great festival, at which thousands of people gather. A more beautiful and fertile spot, however, is not
to be found anywhere in the west.</p>

<p>THE GRAVE OF KIT CARSON, AT TAOS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Nearly midway between the pueblo ruins just mentioned and the city of Santa Fe, along the Rio Grande, is the Cañon Diabolo, a
chasm that is not strikingly deep, but sufficiently weird to justify the Satanic appellation. High up in the walls, particularly near
Espanola, are relics of a vanished race, in the form of excavations which once served as habitations, though evidently they were difficult of
access. The appearance of these rock perforations are very similar to those on the Rio Mancos, and in the cañon cliffs of the Colorado; so
nearly identical, in fact, that Stevenson expresses the belief that they were made by members of the same race, who took refuge in these
caves when driven from their pueblos. At Santa Fe, a short stop was made to await the photographer who had passed around by Trinidad.
The trip which he had made was in
every respect as interesting as that
which we had taken over the direct
southern route. Upon passing beyond
the Sangre de Cristo range eastward,
the scenery grows tamely monotonous
for a time, for the landscape is tiresomely
level. But before reaching
Trinidad, another agreeably surprising
change occurs, as the Raton range
breaks into view, and presents a
kaleidoscopic variety of beautiful
scenes. Trinidad lies at the foot of
this range, and though it may not be
described as a city of great architectural
magnificence, certain it is that few
places can boast of greater interest to
the tourist. It was, long ago, the
most important point on the old Santa
Fe trail, and its ancient adobe houses
were objects of endearment to the hearts
of freighters, because they offered both
refuge and refreshment after the perils
of a dangerous journey. Though a
great change has taken place since the
railroad reached the town, it is still a typical Mexican city, which even the electric light cannot convert. Passing over the border into
New Mexico, the scenery is varied and pleasing, but never grand. Instead of an arid region, however, the country is diversified, for all of
the northeastern region is abundantly watered by creeks flowing towards the southeast, with occasional rivers, like the Canadian,
Cimarron and Pecos, intersecting the railroad. On both sides of the road there are numerous knolls, called mesas, and craters long
since burned out. The ascent of Raton Pass, sometimes called the “Devil’s Way,” affords many exquisite views, of which the Spanish
Peaks, one hundred miles to the north, are chief, for the atmosphere is so clear and rare that they appear as distinct as though the distance
were scarcely one-fourth so great. Upon gaining an altitude of 7,700 feet, the road enters a tunnel on the Raton Crest, and after a
half-mile run emerges on the New Mexico side, where the sunlight appears to be intensified and the warmth of perpetual summer holds
sway. The next considerable town reached after leaving Trinidad is Las Vegas, which reposes on a branch of the Pecos, the center of a
great many sheep ranches, and it is wool that gives it chief importance. Six miles north of the place is Las Vegas Hot Springs, a
sanitarium of much note, located in a region of considerable beauty. They are at the mouth of a small cañon which leads up to the
Spanish Range, and thence joins the Rocky Mountains; the waters range in temperature from boiling hot to almost freezing cold.</p>

The photograph was taken at the bottom of the cañon, and away up near the top may be seen a passing train, which at so great a height looks like a child’s toy. A little mountain stream meanders through the chasm, gently murmuring and singing as it makes its way over the rocks, but when the snows melt and the rains fall it becomes a mad, roaring, rushing torrent, tearing the sides of the mountain and tossing great boulders about as if they were made of straw.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>At a station called Lamy, there is a branch of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, leading north eighteen miles, to the
ancient and interesting city of Santa Fe, celebrated in American history as being the second oldest town in the United States. The place
contains much to entertain searchers after relics of the past, and here we find the links that bind the old Spanish invaders with the civilization
of to-day. Settled by Catholics, it still retains the characteristics impressed upon it by the Franciscan fathers, and remains true to the
faith in which it was first baptized. It is
the seat of the archiepiscopal diocese, and
the Cathedral of San Francisco is the
largest church edifice in the territory, as
well as the oldest, the original part, which
still remains, having been built as early
as 1622.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old as the town is, Santa Fe is the
Phœnix that rose from one that was very
much more ancient, for the site was, in
the ages that are very remote, occupied by
an Indian pueblo, the ruins of which are still
to be seen in what is known as the “Old
Home.” But the most curious and attractive
object within the city is the Governor’s
Palace, a long, low building erected in
1598, a summary history of which is thus

<p>LA VETA PASS, COL.—<span class="multicaption">Over this famous pass the railroad makes its way into San Luis Valley, and we have here a combination of the wonders of engineering skill with a grandeur of view unequaled in any other part of the world. The maximum grade is 237 feet to the mile, and the altitude at the summit is 9393 feet. Two of the largest locomotives are required to draw an ordinary train over the steep grades, and even with these the ascent is labored and tedious. From the top of the pass a view is obtained of such surpassing grandeur that no language can picture it.</span></p>

<p>ABANDONED CAVE HABITATIONS OF THE CLIFF-DWELLERS, NEAR ESPANOLA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Without disparaging the importance
of any of the cherished historical
localities of the East, it may be truthfully
said that this ancient palace surpasses, in
historic interest and value, any other place
or object in the United States. It antedates the settlement of Jamestown by nine years, and that of Plymouth by twenty-two, and has
stood during the 292 years since its erection, not as a cold rock or monument, with no claim upon the interest of humanity except the bare
fact of its continued existence, but as the living center of everything of historic importance in the Southwest. Through all that long
period, whether under Spanish, Pueblo, Mexican, or American control, it has been the seat of power and authority. Whether the ruler
was called viceroy, captain-general, political chief, department commander, or governor, and whether he presided over a kingdom, a
province, a department, or a territory, this has been his official residence. From here Oñate started, in 1599, on his adventurous expedition
to the Eastern plains; here, seven years later, 800 Indians came from far-off Quivira to ask aid in their war with the Axtaos; from here, in
1618, Vincente de Salivar set forth to the Moqui country, only to be turned back by rumors of the giants to be encountered; and from here
Peñalosa and his brilliant troop started, on the 6th of March, 1662, on their marvelous expedition to the Missouri; in one of its strong-rooms
the commissary-general of the Inquisition was imprisoned a few years later by the same Peñalosa; within its walls, fortified as for a siege,
the bravest of the Spaniards were massed in the revolution of 1680; here, on the 19th of August of that year, was given the order to execute
forty-seven Pueblo prisoners, in the plaza which faces the building; here, but a day later, was the sad war-council held which determined
on the evacuation of the city; here was the scene of triumph of the Pueblo chieftains as they ordered the destruction of the Spanish archives
and the church ornaments in one grand conflagration; here De Vargas, on September 14, 1692, after the eleven hours’ combat of the
preceding day, gave thanks to the Virgin Mary, to whose aid he attributed his triumphant capture of the city; here, more than a century
later, on March 3, 1807, Lieutenant
Pike was brought before Governor
Alencaster as an invader of Spanish
soil; here, in 1822, the Mexican
standard, with its eagle and cactus,
was raised in token that New Mexico
was no longer a dependency of Spain;
from here, on the 6th of August,
1837, Governor Perez started to subdue
the insurrection in the north,
only to return two days later and to
meet his death on the 9th, near Agua
Fria; here, on the succeeding day,
Jose Gonzales, a Pueblo Indian of
Taos, was installed as Governor of
New Mexico, soon after to be executed
by order of Armijo; here, in the principal
reception-room, on August 12,
1846, Captain Cooke, the American
envoy, was received by Governor
Armijo and sent back with a message
of defiance; and here, five days later,
General Kearney formally took possession
of the city, and slept, after his
long and weary march, on the carpeted
earthen floor of the palace.”</p>

<p>SPANISH PEAKS, FROM LAS VEGAS, NEW MEXICO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Santa Fe now has many things that belong to the present age: street cars, electric lights, etc., but she is, nevertheless, still a place of
adobe houses, before which there is ever a varied commingling of Americans, Mexicans and Indians. She is also the center of archæological
interest, for besides the ancient objects which are to be found within her urban limits, there are villages near-by which present all the
aspects of the aborigines, practically as they appeared to Cortes and Coronado. These adobe places and their inhabitants are called pueblos,
because that is the old Indian name signifying <i>town</i>. The pueblos in New Mexico are nineteen in number, and while varying in size, they
are very similar in appearance, showing, as they do, no variation of architecture. The houses were built to accommodate from one hundred
to several hundred persons, as the Pueblo Indians were communistic in their manner of living. Instead of being one or two-story structures,
like the present style of Mexican and the old Spanish adobes, the houses were built one upon another, in a succession of terraces, sometimes
five or more in number, the upper stories being accessible only by means of ladders. The most noted of these pueblos are Taos, Laguna,
Acoma, Santa Clara, Zuni and Santo Domingo. Albuquerque was also originally an Indian pueblo, built upon a slight elevation of rock,
and the place still contains several clusters of square, flat-roofed adobe houses, arranged in terraces, as before described. The walls of these
strange dwellings are very thick, and the interior is gained, not through doors, but by entrance-ways cut in the roof, which is reached
only by ladders. The Pueblo
Indians have been pronounced
by many ethnologists to be the
oldest race now living on the
continent, though many others
regard them as being the descendants
of the Aztecs, whose
ancient kingdom of Cibola
extended from Colorado and
Utah on the north, to Central
America on the south. The
capital of this extinct empire is
supposed to have been situated
in Penal county, Arizona, the
ruins of which are traceable
along the Gila River, in what
is known as the Casas Grandes.
Remarkable stories have been
told of the relics of this ruined
city, enthusiasts often describing
them as equal in grandeur
to the prostrate columns and
mighty archways that speak in
imperishable stone of the magnificence
of ancient Egyptian
cities. The Montezumas were
supposed to have held their
court in the splendid stone palaces
whose relics lie scattered
through the Casas Grandes, and
whose carvings and hieroglyphics
seem to attest the departed glory of a once mighty people. These famous ruins are twelve miles north of Florence, a station on
the Southern Pacific, and are in a region of great picturesqueness, which is traversed by a good wagon-road running along the Gila River.
The route is through an arid plain, in which the only vegetation is mesquite and cactus, but the parched desert is gracefully confined by a
beautiful and opalescent range of mountains, while overhead is a sapphirine sky more brilliant than ever hung over Italy. The river
margin is like a blue wave, colored as it is by the tossing heads of wild lilac flowers, which find protection from the beating sun under the
waving branches of banks of willows that stoop low to drink from the river. There, under the shadows of the Tucson Mountains and the
Sierra Catarina range, are the colossal ruins of the Casas Grandes. The buildings, of which confused heaps are all that now remain, were
of irregular style, but of some architectural pretension, for the walls were constructed of concrete, moulded into blocks nearly three feet
square. The principal structure, which has long been called Montezuma’s Palace, was about sixty feet long by fifty broad, and stood five
stories, or forty feet high. For windows there was a square aperture over each door, wholly insufficient for either light or ventilation,
though the ancient Indians were not partial to either, apparently preferring darkness; and living in the closest communal state, they
appreciated fresh air like they
did the storm and cold, only
when it was on the outside.</p>

<p>MEXICAN OVENS, USED PRINCIPALLY BY THE PUEBLO INDIANS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Occasional pieces of
copper are found in the Casas
Grandes ruins, but no iron, and
the cutting instruments of the
original occupants were made
of obsidian, as were their
arrows. Pottery still strews
the ground about, but there are
no evidences to support the old
legends of magnificence with
which early travelers invested
the so-called palace. But there
are plainly to be seen ruins
of a great wall that once enclosed
the city, on which were
sentinel towers rising several
feet above the main wall, thus
proving that this was not entirely
a land of peace, nor do
appearances indicate that it
was one of plenty. The
Apaches, no doubt, harried the
less war-like Moqui, who were
at last driven southward, and
left ruins of similar cities along their gradual retreat from Utah to Mexico. Professor A. L. Heister, the antiquarian, who has made a long
and patient investigation of the pueblo ruins in southwest New Mexico, thus writes of his discoveries:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Within a radius of five miles of St. Joseph, New Mexico, I have discovered several hundred ruins of the habitations of prehistoric
man. In these ruins—the walls of which are built of undressed stone and cement—are found the remains of huge cisterns; walls of fortification;
queer implements of bone and stone; beautifully designed, carved or painted pottery, together with odd and artistic pictures, characters
and symbols cut upon large rocks in cañons near, and with such nicety of taste as serve to strike the beholder with wonder and admiration.</p>

<p>ADOBE VILLAGE OF PUEBLO INDIANS, NEW MEXICO.—<span class="multicaption">The word pueblo in Spanish means village, and this term was applied by the early Spanish explorers to several powerful tribes of Indians whom they found living in adobe villages like the one so beautifully photographed on this page. They had evidently occupied such abodes for centuries before the Spaniards came, and they have not departed from the custom up to the present time. As the increase of a family requires more room, additions are made at the top of the house, and thus we find their homes built in tiers, one above the other, the upper stories being reached by rude ladders, as shown in the illustration. The baking oven, seen at the left of the photograph, is a village institution, and it has been adopted almost universally by the present rural population of Mexico. The Pueblo Indians are rapidly disappearing, their entire number being now less than 1000.</span></p>

ten feet, and six to eight feet in height. In some cases the buildings have been two stories high. There has been a side entrance to all
of these rooms, but these openings, from some cause, have been carefully walled up.</p>

<p>SCENE ON THE GREAT AMERICAN DESERT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“These people were larger than those of to-day, some of them being fully eight feet high. I am led to believe their average height
was not less than seven feet. They buried their dead in the ground floors of their rooms, with the heads towards the east, and, as a rule,
their pottery, trinkets and personal ornaments with them. In excavating these ruins, one is constantly impressed with one paramount
wonder—their great age. Huge pine trees, three and four feet in diameter and 100 feet high, flourish upon the walls and in the rooms of
these habitations of forgotten
man. The infilling of drift and
the increase of surface, caused
by vegetable growth and decay,
is very slow, and has been estimated
by some geologists to
average about one foot in eighty
years. Admitting this to be near
the truth, our surprise knows
no bounds when, on sinking
directly under these giant trees,
we pass through from six to ten
feet of vegetable mold, then encounter
from one to three feet of
clean-washed sand and gravel,
then a solid earthen floor covered
with ashes, charcoal, bones
and fragments of broken pottery.
Yet still below this are
the skeletons of human beings,
surrounded by their pottery,
weapons and ornaments of
stone, bone and copper. My
own opinion is that these people
were either Aztecs or Toltecs.
They were sun-worshipers and
well advanced in carving, painting, building, weaving and agriculture. They flourished many centuries in Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico,
Mexico, Central and South America, and were exterminated either by famine, flood, disease or volcanic action at least 1,000 years ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the eastern part of this (Socorro) county are the ruins of an immense city known as the Grande Quivero, covering two by two
and one-half miles square. Its walls are, in some places, eight feet thick, forty feet high, and 700 feet long. A great aqueduct carried
water to the city, but to-day there is no water within forty miles of this ancient wonder. It stands silent and alone in the sunlight and
moonlight, and where once the love, industry and skill of an unknown race made thousands of beautiful and happy homes, the coyote, bat
and snake now hold sway. When and by whom it was built was a mystery to the Mexican people more than 300 years ago.”</p>

It is a dreary, desolate-looking place, but decidedly better than the average of the homes of savage or uncivilized peoples. The sun-baked mud houses are certainly preferable to an ordinary Indian wigwam, and we are sure the baking ovens would produce sweeter and more wholesome bread than the roving Apaches or Sioux are accustomed to. In fact, the houses, the ovens, and even the dress of the forlorn-looking woman indicate the beginnings of civilization.</span></p>

Leaving Santa Fe, we continued our journey westward over the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, and striking the
Rio Grande a short distance south of White Rock Cañon, followed the bank of that stream through some very handsome
scenery until we reached Atlantic and Pacific Junction. Thence for a while the route was through an arid section, where alkali
and musquite abounded; an unchangeable waste of black sterility; a country so level that the laying of a railroad track was
attended by no difficulties, but keeping it clear of sand is a work of great perverseness. We were now on the line of the
Atlantic and Pacific, which crosses a branch of the Rio Grande at Rio Puerco, and soon after follows the valley of that
stream for about sixty miles. Laguna is on the way, and north and south are mesas, dry lakes and lava beds, but there is no picturesqueness
of landscape. South of
Fort Wingate, just east of the Arizona
border, is the Zuni Plateau, in which
several old ruins are still to be seen;
but if we except the Indians, who
exist in the most miserable condition,
and old ruins and craters of extinct
volcanoes, the region is without interest,
and has few features worthy of
the photographer’s art.</p>

<p class='c011'>After reaching Arizona, the
road passes through a corner of the
Perco and Zuni reservations, and follows
the old trail leading to Prescott.
Immediately south of Flagstaff, and in
sight of that place, are more ruins of
cliff dwellings, built in the banks of
Walnut Creek, but so faded as to be
scarcely distinguishable now. We
are now in the Cactus plain, where
immense stalks of that curious vegetable
growth rise to the dignity of
branchless trees, prickly and often
grotesque.</p>

under Spanish and American rule, and is still occupied for this purpose. It fronts the plaza or public park, a portion of which is
shown in the picture, and a brilliant scene is witnessed here on a summer’s afternoon when the officers of the garrison stationed here,
with their families and visiting friends, gather under the shade of the trees to listen to the excellent music of the military band. The
old adobe church is probably older by at least two centuries than any other church house in America, and a few years ago, when the

<p>NATURAL BRIDGE, NEAR MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>At a little station called Peach
Springs, the road draws very near the
Hualpai reservation, and is within less than a score of miles of the Grand Cañon of the Colorado; but, though short, the way is a difficult
one, over parched sands and an eye-wearying desolation, until within four or five miles of the cañon, when the approach to water is
indicated by a gradual increase of vegetation, which, however, never becomes rank, even along the river-shore. A stage-line is now
running from Flagstaff, which, though not so near as Peach Springs, offers a much easier route to the cañon. The trip from Flagstaff is
made in twelve hours, and, by comfortable stages, the traveler is taken to one of the most imposing points in the cañon (Marble Cañon),
where the descent is sheer 6,000 feet, and a panorama is afforded of frightful chasm, curiously chaotic walls, strange formations, and mountains
breaking one behind the other, like waves on the ocean, until sight fades into the perspective of distance. Here terror and sublimity,
in a marvel of natural extremes,
have formed perpetual alliance
to excite amazement in the
mind of every visitor.</p>

<p class='c011'>We cross the Colorado at
Powell, where, to the south, are
Red Rock buttes, and to the
north are the Needles, the latter
being hills that run up into
sharp peaks, and then fall away
to join a long stretch of plain.
Black Mountains run parallel
with the river on the north,
near the foot of which, but on
the river-shore, is a Mohave
village, a settlement of that
miserable remnant, who from
a powerful people have degenerated,
through oppression and
decimation, until they are
scarcely a degree removed from
the Digger Indians. The reservation
proper of this tribe is,
however, near the Navajoes, in
the northeastern part of the

<p>THE GREAT TELESCOPE, IN LICK OBSERVATORY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Crossing the Colorado, we
strike the desert district of
California, which extends
through the counties of San
Bernardino and Kern, a distance
of nearly three hundred miles. Adjoining these two counties on the north is Inyo county, into which the Carson and Colorado Railroad
extends southward as far as Owen’s Lake. This county is remarkable for embracing a region of extraordinary wonders, greater, indeed,
in several respects, than any other district in the world. In the northern part is a marvelous depression, 159 feet below sea level, and
nearly 150 miles in circumference, known as Death Valley. It is distinctly a volcanic region, in which, however, the fires are long since
burned out, leaving the desert a vast field of cinders,
so parched that no drop of water exists within its
borders, though rivers of lava ramify it in every
direction. Many have perished in an effort to cross
this fiery plain; and looking across it from the margin,
the observer sees a shimmer in the air, as if a furnace
were in active blast beneath. Here the temperature
rises to 122 degrees, and the air hangs in a hot
envelope, lazily swinging to and fro, rising and falling
in waves of heat, and making the sands blaze
with an almost blinding light. Scorched, burned-out
and furnace-like though the region be, it is,
nevertheless, the abode of life, but no less curious
than is the valley itself. The centipede, scorpion
and horned-toad find here a congenial habitation;
and, strange to say, a species of kangaroo-rat is peculiar
to this cursed spot, burrowing in the hot sand
and feeding on insects.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thunder-storms beat around the valley, but
no drop of rain ever moistens its burning lips. The
dryness of the air is such a preserver of dead bodies
that decay is impossible, and the animals that die
within its borders are mummified until they become
like parchment. This cursed spot, sown as it is
with dragon’s teeth, is not entirely without its attractions,
though they are as dangerous as were the soft,
lute-like voices of the Sirens. It is the field of wonderful
illusion, from which spring into the quivering
air the most astounding and alluring mirages: rippling
brooks, waving palms, floral meadows, ships
under sail, banks of thyme, and travelers moving in
procession across a landscape more beautiful than an
oriental vision.</p>

<p class='c011'>Continuing our journey westward, we passed
through a large arid district, in which dry lakes with
beds white with soda, and shining in the blazing
sun, were plentiful on both sides, but seeing no more
interesting features until we arrived at Los Angeles.
Here we found much to amuse, and often to instruct.
It is an old town, settled by the Spaniards, in 1780,
and although now a beautiful city, it has not entirely put aside the garments of antiquity with which the ancient church fathers invested it.
Many old adobe buildings still remain, and there are not wanting the ruins of quaint and curious monasteries, moss-covered, and with
broken walls and dilapidated belfries, in which the ghosts of long ago seem to have their haunt.</p>

<p>WITHIN THE JAWS OF GRAND CAÑON OF THE COLORADO.—<span class="multicaption">The Grand Cañon of the Colorado is such a stupendous wonder that we never grow tired of contemplating it. From every point of view we see some new marvel to admire. The variegated and many-hued cliffs are as remarkable for their bewildering beauty as for the grandeur of their lofty heights. Everything is on the most colossal scale, except the little river itself, which goes dashing along in playfulness and glee with no intimation that it is the master workman by whose hands this stupendous wonder was wrought.</span></p>

<p>OUR STAGE-COACH CROSSING THE SANTA INEZ.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The river, which washes the eastern limits of the city, is a sluggish stream, but it imparts refreshment to one of the most fertile
valleys to be found anywhere in California. Here we find a succession of orange-groves and vineyards, bending low with golden and purple
fruitage, while beyond the city’s skirts are orchards of walnut, olive and almond, from which profitable crops are annually gathered.</p>

<p class='c011'>San Diego, 147 miles
south of Los Angeles, is another
beautiful place, the center of a
delightful region, but its interest
lies very largely in the fact
that it was at this place the first
white settler in California
pitched his tent, as early as
1769. This great Spanish pioneer,
Father Junipero Serra by
name, became the founder of
twenty-one missions in California,
some of which still
remain in a fair state of preservation,
but a majority exist as
mere reminders of the olden
time when the Franciscan friars
dominated that portion of the
Spanish territory. In this
southern region the landscape
is monotonous, and the air is
usually hot, from which fact, no
doubt, came the name “California,”
which, in the Spanish,
signifies “hot furnace,” and
was bestowed by the discoverer,
in 1534.</p>

<p>THE GRIZZLY GIANT, MARIPOSA GROVE OF BIG TREES.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Proceeding northward,
the scenery becomes more varied and pleasing, for above Los Angeles a mountainous district is passed, with the San Bernardino and
Sierra de San Rafael ranges on the right, and the Monica and Santa Inez ranges on the left. Still further north are the San Benito
Mountains, paralleling the San Juan River, along whose magnificent valley the railroad runs until it reaches Castroville on the coast, just
above Monterey. This latter place is one of very great attractiveness, not only for its historical associations, as the seat of Spanish Government
in California until 1847, but also because it is the best specimen of the old-time adobe cities which now remains, as well as the location
of one of the most exquisite gardens and charming hotels that is to be found either in or out of America. The Hotel del Monte is a building
of much beauty in itself, but the very large
grounds which surround it have been cultivated
until they are a veritable paradise of
noble oaks, rich green lawns, and bewildering
flower-beds, dimpled with every hue that
nature is capable of painting. The old town
is a ghost of antiquity, the skeleton of a
remote past, whose bony fingers point backward,
as if beckoning beseechingly to the
long ago. There is the mission house,
rickety and tattered, raising its palsied head
barely above the adobe walls which once
served so well to defend it against enemies.
But the wall, very thick though it was, has
been badly breached by the catapults of
time, and having done faithful guard-duty
in the early days, it is now like the grave of
a hero, which has become a shrine, to which
many are drawn by curiosity as well as
by respect.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Monterey northward the road
runs through the incomparably beautiful
and fertile Santa Clara Valley, a region where
nature is always in good humor, and so fat
that every time she laughs she shakes out a
harvest. Towards the left spreads away a
waving plain in richest cultivation, while on
the right towers the Coast range of mountains,
whose summits, bathed perpetually in
a clear atmosphere, look in the distance like
a vast ridge of sapphires supporting the sky.</p>

He was the first white man to settle within the limits of the territory now embraced by the great State of the Pacific coast. His object in going there was to serve as a missionary among the Indians, and so earnest and faithful was he that he lived to become the founder of twenty-one missions.

<p>BRIDAL VEIL FALL, YOSEMITE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>At San Jose, a lovely city embowered
with oaks, vines, roses and palms, the stage
is taken for Mount Hamilton, upon the peak
of which is located the Lick Observatory,
enclosing the great Lick telescope. The
road cost $80,000 to make; and though the
ascent, which is begun fifteen miles from
San Jose, is great, yet so admirably constructed
is the way that two horses easily
drag the stage to the summit.
I never had a more delightful
ride than this trip afforded, for
while the air was bracing, the
view was at all times indescribably
picturesque. At places
where sharp turns are made,
passengers can look out of the
coach windows down into
abysses which seem to be bottomless,
and which never fail
to elicit the question: “If a
wheel should run off the edge,
where would the passengers
land?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The altitude of the observatory
is 4,250 feet above the
valley, and from this lofty point,
it is claimed, with an appearance
of truth, that a greater area
is visible than from any other
in the world. Not only is the
whole of Santa Clara Valley
viewable, but on very clear
days the highest peaks of the
Yosemite are discernible, and
even Mount Shasta, 200 miles
distant, can be distinguished.
The telescope is a 36-inch reflector,
the largest ever made, and
so massive that it is controlled
by hydraulic power, which is
most ingeniously applied, the
adjustment being so perfect that
its many tons of weight can be
moved by a single finger. The
public have free access to the
observatory, but unfortunately,
and very unwisely, visitors are
not permitted to use the
telescope except on Saturday nights. As favorable evenings are comparatively
few, this rule prevents a very great majority of persons from
realizing what they have traveled thousands of miles to see, and much
complaint against the astronomers in charge is accordingly made.</p>

<p>EL CAPITAN, 3,300 FEET HIGH, YOSEMITE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From San Jose to San Francisco the distance is about fifty miles,
through forests of redwood, past charming villas skirting San Francisco
Bay, and many beauties peculiar to this perpetual summer land. The
city is one of exceedingly great interest, possessing as it does features of
a unique as well as of a magnificent character. Some of its best streets
are reclamations from the bay, where, in 1849, the largest ships rode at
anchor; and what were once bare mountains of sand were made accessible
by the adoption of a cable system of street railroads, and on these peaks
are now several of the finest residences in America.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Palace Hotel is the largest in the world, nine stories high,
occupying 275 by 350 feet of ground, and cost, with furnishings, the
enormous sum of $7,000,000. The public buildings, and many of the
business blocks as well, attest the great wealth of the place, which flowed
in with the gold discoveries. Lone Mountain, distinguished by a large
wooden cross on its summit, affords a view which embraces not only the
entire city and bay, but likewise of the ocean, Mount Diabolo and the
long Coast Range that shimmers in the sun like polished metal.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the most delightful point of interest is the Cliff House, near
the entrance to the Golden Gate, reached by a beautiful drive through
Golden Gate Park, and also by cable and steam cars. The prospect from
the hotel piazza, reaching far above and over the ocean, is both grand
and charming. Immediately in front, and only three or four hundred
yards away, three rocks rise out of the sea to a height of one hundred
feet, and on these hundreds of sea-lions gather of sunny days to bask
and display themselves before amused spectators. At times, their barking
is almost distracting, especially when some ugly-dispositioned pater
familias of the great herd sets about clearing the rocks, when there
follows a noise like ten thousand big dogs in conflict, and a scrambling,
sprawling and tumbling that is wonderful as well as amusing.</p>

<p>VERNAL FALLS AND LADY FRANKLIN ROCK, YOSEMITE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>San Francisco is a center from which many interesting itineraries
may be conveniently made, several of which we performed, with the
particular view of photographing the most attractive features. Chief of
these excursions is to the Yosemite Valley, which is 267 miles from San
Francisco, the last sixty-seven miles being journeyed by stage. Leaving
that city at 4 <span class='fss'>P. M.</span>, we reached Raymond at 6 <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> the following day,
at which point the stage is taken to Wawona, which is only six miles
from the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees. These
giants of the primeval forest are in a Government
reservation two miles square, and compose
two distinct groves some half a mile apart. In
the upper grove there are 365—one for each
day in the year—trees, 154 of which exceed
fifteen feet in diameter, and several are more
than 300 feet in height. The largest, known
as the Grizzly Giant, in the lower grove, is
thirty-one feet in diameter, and the first limb
which makes out from the trunk, 200 feet above
the earth, is six feet in diameter. There is a
prostrate tree in this grove which originally
measured forty feet in diameter, and was 400
feet in height. The body is hollow, and is
large enough to admit three horsemen abreast
a distance of seventy feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few miles beyond Wawona is a stage-station
called Fresno, which is within the limits
of another grove of mammoth trees, the largest
of which is thirty-two feet in diameter at the
butt, and there are probably 100 or more that
measure as much as twenty feet through. Just
beyond Fresno, we enter the far-famed and
truly marvelous region of the Yosemite (which,
in the Indian tongue, signifies a “grizzly
bear”), that great heart of the Sierras which
beats in mountain and breaks in waterfall. This
wondrous valley, running along the western
base of the Sierra Nevada range, is a comparatively
level area, but it lies fully 4,000 feet
above sea level, and is nine miles long, by an
average of one mile wide. The remarkable
feature of this valley, aside from its special
curiosities and mammoth configurations, is the
fact that it is enclosed by granite walls of
almost unbroken continuity, which present perpendicular
faces ranging from 3,000 to 6,000
feet in height. The valley was discovered
May 6, 1851, by the Mariposa battalion, in
command of Major James D. Savage,
which had been sent against the
Yosemite Indians, to punish them
for outrages perpetrated against the
miners in the counties of Mariposa,
Fresno, Tuolumne and Inyo. Up to
this time the valley was known to
whites only through Indian traditions,
which represented the region
as one of great beauty, but the abode
of witches and evil spirits. Upon
the discovery, however, it was found
to be a place of refuge for the
Indians; and within its boundaries,
therefore, some desperate fighting
took place between the California
rangers and the Yosemite Indian
marauders, in which there were
heavy losses on both sides, and many
acts of shocking cruelty.</p>

<p class='c011'>The stage-road leading from
Wawona is particularly romantic and
delightfully picturesque, with views
of mountains, laughing streams and
beflowered valleys, that break in
pleasing variety upon the expectant
vision of the visitor, and give intimation
of the grander glories that
lie beyond. After crossing Alder
Creek, a beautiful stream that
washes a pebbled bed, the route
mounts Alder Hill, and rises rapidly
until from its apex there is afforded
an amazing sight, which never fails
to throw the beholder into raptures.
Northward, like a thread of silver
running through a labyrinth of
mountains, is the South Fork, while
southward the same stream speeds
away to join the Merced River, which
dashes through a stupendous gorge aflame with
colors. Descending Alder Hill on the east, by
way of a tortuous route, we at last reach Merced
Valley, beautiful as a poet’s inspiration, and crossing
this low-lying strip of meadow land, climb
another hill, where wonder compels us to pause
upon its crest. Away yonder in the misty west,
where the horizon drops down like a curtain on
the world to hide the mysteries behind, are the
dim outlines of the Coast Range, nearly 200 miles
distant. But more bewildering sights are near at
hand, for there to the left a little way are noisy
cascades playing leap-frog over giant stones; Table
Rock is close by, and El Capitan, that grizzled
old captain of the Yosemite, exposes his shoulder,
which seems to be a prop for the clouds. A few
miles further and we reach Inspiration Point,
where a glorious vision of Yosemite Valley and its
Titanic walls break upon us with a startling
suddenness, revealing a section of nature that is
incomparably grand and awesomely magnificent.
El Capitan forges upward 3,300 feet; the Three
Brothers keep him company to a yet greater altitude,
while in the background, frowzled, yet
sublime, loom up against the cerulean sky the
gray Cathedral Rocks, lying within the deep
shadows of Sentinel Rock. Look around, for on
every side appear evidences of mightiness, the
awfulness of those powers which sometimes escape
from internal reservoirs, or break away from the
fastnesses where they were born; the bursting of
lava beds, the tearing down of glacier, the down-sweeping
of avalanche, and the steady flow of
gnawing waters.</p>

<p class='c011'>A trip through the Yosemite Valley is one
of profound amazement, a succession of astounding
surprises, where the most amazing prodigies of
nature stand before you in review. Why, throw
a glance up yonder, so far that though the atmosphere
is wondrously clear, yet the trees on the
crest are not distinguishable, only a white ribbon
that appears to have been flung down over the
narrow edge of that appalling summit to attract
attention. What we see is the first leap of
Yosemite Falls, dashing through a notch that is
nearly half a mile wide, and which has a fall from
three ledges of 2,548 feet, or sixteen times greater
than that of Niagara. There, not far away, is
Glacier Point, which is 3,000 feet high, and from
which a view of the entire valley can be had.
Standing on that pinnacle, we gather in a glorious
panorama of extraordinary splendor. The great
domes of the Yosemite are plainly discernible; so
is Liberty Cap, Clouds’ Rest, Vernal Falls, Nevada
Falls, placid lakes, and the swift-rolling Merced
River, that collects and bears away the waters that
plunge down from a dozen dizzy heights.</p>

The photograph on this page is a fine example of this attractive feature, the reflection being so perfect that it is difficult to determine which is the right side of the picture.

<p class='c011'>But besides these, as we turn to sweep the
other points, we catch views no less grand, of
Ribbon Fall, with its leap of 3,350 feet, Indian
Cañon, Royal Arches, Bridal Veil Fall, Washington’s
Tower, Columbia Rock, and pearl-gray
granite walls that rise in places to a vertical height
of 6,000 feet. More beautiful, in some respects,
than any of these, as many believe, are Mirror
Lake, which seems to reflect nearly the whole
valley, and Cascade Falls, which are indescribably
lovely. The meadows draw our admiration likewise,
for they are so covered with flowers as to
appear like a carpet of the most gorgeous patterns,
done in the liveliest combination of brilliant colors.
Other points of great interest are the Giant’s
Thumb, Eagle Peak, Valley Ford, the Gnome of
the Yosemite, Mount Watkins, 4,000 feet high,
and Tis-sa-ack (Half Dome), 5,000 feet in height,
which was regarded by the Indians as the Guardian
Angel of the valley, for upon the south side of it
are the distinct outlines of a human face, declared
in a legend to be those of Tu-tock-ah-nu-lah,
ancient father of the Yosemites. And there are
the Three Brothers, called by the Indians Pom-pom-pa-sa,
which signifies “three mountains playing
leap-frog,” a name no doubt bestowed because of the
popularity of that game with the original natives,
and also because the mountains, from a distance,
bear a strong resemblance to three giant frogs sitting
side by side, upon the point of leaping into the
valley, nearly 4,000 feet below.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are several great falls in this wonderful
reservation, which, in point of beauty, exceed those
in any other part of the world. Yosemite Falls is
incomparably the greatest in height, and in the
months of May, June and July, the volume of water
which it pours down is second only to Niagara and
Shoshone. Its first vertical leap is 1,500 feet, where
it strikes a series of ledges which break the water
into cascades for another fall of 626 feet, after which
it takes a sheer plunge of 400 feet, and flows away
into the Merced, making a roaring noise in its
impetuous descent that can be heard for miles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bridal Veil Fall is the termination of a creek
bearing the same name, where it plunges over a
precipice 900 feet high, and the stream is so thin
that it becomes a very mist before reaching the
valley. Directly opposite is Virgin Tears Creek,
which likewise dashes over a lofty ledge through a
notch in El Capitan, 1,000 feet high, and falls in a
spray, though during a greater part of the year the
creek is nearly dry.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first fall reached in ascending the cañon
of the Merced is Vernal Fall, which has a vertical
height of 400 feet and a very considerable volume.
But as we proceed further up the cañon, passing a
number of cascades, the eye suddenly catches what
the ear has anticipated, and rapture succeeds expectation,
for there bursts into view Nevada Falls, which,
as Professor Whitney says, “is in every respect one
of the grandest waterfalls in the world, whether we
consider its vertical height, the purity and volume
of the river which forms it, or the stupendous scenery
by which it is environed. The fall is not quite perpendicular, as there is near the summit a ledge of rock which receives a portion of the
water and throws it off with a peculiar twist, adding considerably to the general picturesque effect.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The fall is about 600 feet, the stream being clearly defined throughout its descent, and the volume of water is very great, giving to
the falls the very ideal of beauty, power and truly extraordinary grandeur. In the Cañon of the South Fork, there is another fall of equal
height, and it is one, too, of much attractiveness, but brought into comparison with that of Nevada, of which it is a close brother, though
difficult to reach, it appears so
inconsequential as to scarcely
deserve a name, though it is
occasionally known as Illillouette
Falls.</p>

<p class='c011'>But everywhere, up and
down that magic valley,
whether viewed from the gorges
that have their bottoms in dark
and mystic abysses, or from
amazing heights of walls thrust
far into the skies, there is
wonder piled upon wonder,
grandeur overtopping rapture,
dumfounded admiration riding
at furious pace in the lead of
inspiration, glorious realization
gilding the visions of imagination.
As the gifted Benjamin
F. Taylor wrote of his visit to
this wonderland: “Yosemite
awaited us without warning.
Spectral white in the glancing
of the sun, the first thought was
that the granite ledges of all
the mountains had come to resurrection,
and were standing
pale and dumb before the Lord.
I turned to it again, and began
to see the towers, the domes,
the spires, the battlements, the
arches and the white clouds of solid granite, surging up into the air and come to everlasting anchor until the mountains shall be moved!
You hasten on; you hear the winds intoning in the choral galleries a mile above your head; you hear the crash of waters as of cataracts in
the sky; you trample upon broad shadows that have fallen thousands of feet down, like the cast-off garments of descending night.”</p>

<p>CAVE ROCK, LAKE TAHOE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Instead of returning direct to San Francisco, by way of the route we had taken to the Yosemite, we went northward, over a very
good road, through Tuolumne and into Calaveras county, near the eastern edge of which is the very celebrated grove of giant trees. The
grove is confined within a valley some 3,000 feet long by 800 feet wide, and embraces ninety-three mammoth trees, some of which are
prostrate. The tallest now standing is 325 feet high, and measures fifteen feet in diameter. There are others which, though less lofty,
exceed the tallest in girth measurement by as much as twenty feet in circumference, while the thickness of the bark on these grizzly giants
is as much as eighteen inches. Five miles southeast of the Calaveras forest is the Stanislaus Grove, of about 800 trees, which in any
other country than California
would be considered as veritable
monsters for size; but they do
not equal the better specimens
in either the Calaveras or Mariposa
Groves, though several
have a height of 250 feet, and
a trunk circumference of
thirty feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having inspected and
photographed the groves, we
proceeded to Murphy’s Hotel,
sixteen miles from the Calaveras
Grove, thence twenty-five miles
by stage to Valley Springs, a
station on a narrow-gauge railroad
that runs to Lodi, where
connection is made for San
Francisco.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not possible, without
occupying years of time,
to make trips over all the
picturesque rail-routes of
America, and the transportation
of our material in a photograph
car, which was in almost
constant use, made it necessary
that our three photographers
travel together, except when it
was desirable to cover in quick
time short detours from main
lines. For this reason the overland trip from Denver was made by way of the southern route, without dividing our party; but to provide
against what would otherwise have been a serious omission, the photographer of the Southern Pacific Railroad was brought into service to
supply views of scenery along that road between Ogden and San Francisco, over which the writer has traveled so frequently as to be
thoroughly familiar with all the points of interest. It was this route, formerly known as the Central Pacific, joining the Union Pacific at
Ogden, that constituted the first all-rail overland road from Omaha to San Francisco, and it continues to hold rank as the most picturesque,
though the scenery alternates with many dreary patches.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>After leaving Ogden, the Southern Pacific passes in a half-circle around the northern shores of Salt Lake, and then darts into the
Nevada, or Great American Desert, a vast sea of alkali rippled with dry sage-brush; a furnace in summer and a Siberian tundra in winter.
Nature has denied to this wretched region any compensation of flower, stream, bird, or even curiosity. It is the very nakedness of bleak desolation,
and stretches its cursed
length through a distance of 600
miles. The Humboldt River has
tried to force a way through this
parched waste; but however
great its volume of water, gathered
from the mountains in
spring freshets, the desert
drinks it up at a place known as
the Humboldt Sink, where the
thirst of the sands is so great
that the river is arrested and
stands still in a shallow lake,
the resort of myriads of water-fowls.</p>

<p class='c011'>But though the land is a
wind-swept waste of alkali,
scorched, denuded and cursed,
yet men have planted their
hopes even there, and are wrestling
with the harshest and most
unpromising disadvantages.
Indian camps are frequent, and
villages are occasional, where a
few brave men, inured to all
difficulties, scratch the parched
earth and seek a precarious
sustenance, though nearly all
are traders, furnishing supplies
to miners in the mountains
miles away.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dreary, lifeless monotony is relieved, however, just before reaching Humboldt Lake, by the bold but rugged contour of sky-piercing
pinnacles, which rise to the south of the road in curious forms and extraordinary magnitude, marking the line of Humboldt River.
These interesting formations are known as the Humboldt Palisades, in which the Devil’s Peak is conspicuous, viewed from the car window.
After so many hours passed in crossing a wretched desert, the scenery of meandering river and lofty bluffs is extremely invigorating, and
preparation to enjoy the sight is complete. But the palisades are singularly beautiful, viewed under any conditions, and situated near the
edge of an alkali wilderness, as they are, they break upon the vision of a west-bound passenger with a delight that arouses rapture.</p>

<p>HEATHER LAKE AND MOUNTAIN SCENERY ABOUT LAKE TAHOE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>At Wadsworth, Truckee Valley is entered, green with the joy of exuberant nature, which we follow until Truckee City, a gem of
the Sierras, is gained, and realize that we have now to climb over the second ridge of the continent, the ragged ribs that flank the great
water-shed of the three Americas. Truckee is not only a pretty village, nestling on the snowy bosom of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, but
it is the center of a lake region,
wherein abound some of the
most remarkable bodies of water
to be found on the globe. Fourteen
miles towards the south is
California’s favorite resort, Lake
Tahoe, a really marvelous sheet
of crystalline water that, from
the mountain peaks which enclose
it, looks like a colossal
beryl that through some disturbment
has been rolled out of the
sky and found lodgment in the
great lap of the Sierras. The
environs of the lake are wondrously
grand, and the air a
very enchantment, so great is
its exhilaration. The lake is
twenty-two miles long, ten
miles wide, and 1,700 feet deep,
while the surface is 6,247 feet
above sea level, and it is, as
Mark Twain eloquently describes
it, “a sea in the clouds;
a sea that has character, and
asserts it at times in solemn
calms, and again in savage
storms; a sea whose royal seclusion
is guarded by a cordon of
sentinel peaks that lift their
frosty fronts 9,000 feet above
the level world; a sea whose every aspect is impressive, whose belongings are beautiful, whose lonely majesty types the Deity.” Tahoe’s
waters abound with trout and other fish, whose bodies flash the sunlight from a depth of thirty feet. The waters are so cold that decomposition
is arrested below the surface. Many persons have been drowned in the lake, but not one has ever been recovered, when the accident occurred
in deep water. So pellucid are its waters that a boat gliding along the surface appears to be passing through the air, and from the prows
of swift-moving crafts, sheets of clearest glass seem to be rolling away. Many beautiful cottages are built along the shore, the summer
homes of wealthy Californians, and in season the lake is animate with boats and the beach alive with pleasure parties.</p>

<p>DONNER LAKE, NEAR TRUCKEE, CALIFORNIA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A little way west of Truckee, and three miles from the road, is Donner Lake, a beautiful body, but chiefly famous for the tragic
history which is connected with it. The story, in brief, is this: In the winter of 1846-47, a party of eighty-two emigrants, while on their
way to California, were overtaken by a snow-storm while encamped on the shore of the lake, and of the number thirty-six perished of
starvation. A ghastly tale of
cannibalism is told of the survivors,
and the whole tragedy is
embalmed in Bret Harte’s
novel of “Gabriel Conroy.”
Besides these two more celebrated
bodies of water near
Truckee, there are Pyramid,
Angeline, Silver, and Palisade
lakes, all near by, and are more
or less popular resorts, particularly
with fishing parties.</p>

<p class='c011'>As we proceed up the
Sierras the cold increases, until
when the town of Summit is
reached snow lies upon the
ground throughout the year,
and it is perpetual winter there,
7,000 feet above the sea. The
route is for many miles enclosed
by snow-sheds, but the snow-plow
has plenty of work to do
in keeping the intervals clear.
Formerly this work was performed
by three or four engines
pushing a big machine, somewhat
resembling a shovel-board
plow, through the heavy banks
of snow, but it is now more
speedily and effectively accomplished
by a rotary snow-plow,
as shown in one of our illustrations. The machine is, in fact, a giant auger, which is run by steam supplied by the engines behind
it, and being set in motion, rapidly bores its way through the drifts, throwing the snow at an angle of forty-five degrees, and with a force
sufficient to deposit it fifty feet from the track.</p>

walls. As the cars roll round the jagged point they are on a level with the clouds, while below for nearly 2000 feet appear the forests of pine trees, so reduced in size by

<p>SNOW SHOVELERS CUTTING A BLOCKADE ON THE SIERRA NEVADAS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The road begins to descend rapidly after leaving Summit, but the most wonderful scenery in all California is passed in the next 150
miles. Donner’s Peak comes into view as the first suggestion of a dreadfully tumultuous condition of nature, wrought by the great glaciers
that in the early centuries came grinding their way over the mountains. There is Emigrant Gap, through which the first gold-seekers
found their way into the Golden Valley, and American Cañon, along the dizzy edge of which the train runs at a free and almost reckless pace.
The way is broken with quarreling cascades, fast-dashing creeks and beautiful blue cañons, in which an autumn haze perpetually lingers.
Giant’s Gap, in the American Cañon, is a vast rent in an opposing mountain, that looks like it might have been torn out by the hand of the
Thunder God to make a way
for the trolls. Chasm after
chasm comes into view with
grandeur and awfulness as a
background until presently the
train runs out on a ledge that
appears to passengers inside the
coaches to have no more substantial
support than a bank of
clouds. We are away up high
on the breast of a mountain that
shoots upward 2,000 feet perpendicularly,
and looking out of
the car windows there is nothing
but clouds bowling along on
the same level, and below forests
of pine, stunted by distance,
until the trees are no bigger
than whisk-brooms, and American
River is a white thread not
too large to run through the eye
of a darning-needle. This is
Cape Horn, where the ledge is
so precipitous that in making
the road-bed it was necessary
to lower the first workmen by
means of ropes, which were
held fast at the summit while
the suspended men plied their
picks and crow-bars until a
footing was made.</p>

Nevada Mountains of California, made famous by Mark Twain in one of his jokes, wherein he stated that the changes of climate in that region were so sudden and extreme
that, while hunting in the mountains one day, his dog’s head was sun-struck by the intense heat, while at the same time his tail was frozen by the severe cold prevailing
at his other extremity. The point of the joke will be appreciated after reading the splendid description of this locality by the author of <span class='sc'>Glimpses of America</span> on

<p>A ROTARY SNOW PLOW CUTTING THROUGH A BLOCKADE ON THE SIERRAS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>After leaving Cape Horn, and passing many relics of early mining days: holes in the ground, decaying sluice-boxes, long flumes,
tumble-down shanties, and a few hydraulic works, the road gains the Sacramento Valley, where the passengers are met by a burst of
sunshine that makes the land laugh with plenty, and fills every heart with gladness. The air is fragrant with the almond and orange, and
where husbandry has not covered the broad-spreading acres with grain or vineyards, there are flowers of a thousand hues, and butterflies of
corresponding colors. The early emigrants from the East, who sought fortune on the Pacific slope after the gold discoveries of 1848-49,
found a paradise in the fragrant and prolific valley of the Sacramento, which, beautiful at all times, was to them, after a journey of almost
unbearable hardships across the burning sands of the American Desert, a region of incomparable delight. There is, indeed, no contrast in
all nature so sudden and so great as that afforded between Nevada and California, the line of separation being the Sierras. Out of the arid
plains, a very ocean of verdureless desolation, the road rises rapidly to altitudes of perpetual snow and into forests of pine that cover the
sides of fearful precipices, the
peaks of towering mountains
and the jaws of yawning
chasms; then it swoops down
again into a land of perennial
bloom, the antithesis of that of
the eastern desert, where, instead
of parching, the sun
revivifies and forces into fruitage
orchards, vineyards, groves,
gardens, and fields, making the
land one of teeming plenty,
and joyful with song of bird,
flash of stream, gleam of golden
grain, and resonant with the
laughing chorus of exuberant
nature. More fortunes have
been won by aid of the hoe and
sickle wielded in this charming
valley than were ever gained by
means of pick, flame and rocker
on the harsh mountain sides,
where the gold-seekers have
toiled so hopefully for forty
years, and in a great majority
of cases spent their strength
without reward.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first time that I crossed
the Sierras was in early autumn,
before the crisp air had begun
to clip the leaves, and when
Nevada appeared to be swept with a stifling atmosphere; hot, dusty and dreary was the pale sands, and the gray sage-brush was withered
as by a simoom’s breath; I wondered why tourists, on pleasure bent, should make such a journey. Then out of the plain of dearth, and up
the mountains we sped; suddenly, as it were, the atmosphere grew chill, flakes of snow began to descend; the way led out of hot summer
into severe winter, and the landscape became a picture of tumult, mighty, wonderful and picturesque. Then we rolled down the Sierras
into a land of indescribable beauty, into a garden as lovely as that of Hesperides—and the answer was plain.</p>

Winter had been spent in the vernal climate of New Mexico, Arizona and California, and we had so nicely calculated our work
that when April arrived we were ready for explorations in northern fields. Accordingly, early in that month, we took our
departure from San Francisco, over the California and Oregon Railroad (property of the Southern Pacific), to photograph the
natural wonders of the extreme northwest. The road which we had thus selected is one of the most charmingly picturesque in
America, abounding as it does with an infinite variety of beautiful valleys, leaping cascades, roaring waterfalls, snow-capped
mountains, and abysmal cañons
that are wrapped in eternal
darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>After leaving Sacramento,
the route follows the Sacramento
Valley, through a marvelously
fertile district, cleft
by an exquisite stream that
bellows, gushes, gurgles and
rambles in a devious way from
summerless peaks, through
blossoming vales, and down
mellow meadows, until it drops
into the arms of the sea.</p>

<p>UPPER CASCADE OF CHILNUALNU FALLS, YOSEMITE.—<span class="multicaption">It has been said by a distinguished writer that “either the domes or the waterfalls of Yosemite, or any single one of them, would be sufficient in any European country to attract travelers from far and wide. Waterfalls in the vicinity of Yosemite, surpassing in beauty many of the best known and most visited in Europe, are actually left unnoticed by travelers, because there are so many other objects to be visited that it is impossible to find time for them all.” This will doubtless explain why the beautiful cascade photographed on this page is so little known that it is not even described in the leading guide-books. It is one of the most attractive waterfalls in Yosemite, but it has so many neighbors equally beautiful and grander that it is passed by almost unnoticed.</span></p>

<p>NAJAQUI FALLS, GAVIOTA PASS, CAL.—<span class="multicaption">Gaviota Pass is located in Santa Barbara County, and possesses some of the finest scenery to be found anywhere in the State. The photograph on this page will afford a good idea of the delightful visions to be seen in this region. The falls are neither grand nor majestic, but they are exceedingly beautiful, and the secluded retreat, fringed with ferns and mosses, where but few sounds are heard except the gentle splashing of the constantly falling water, is a place to be sought and loved on a warm summer day.</span></p>

<p>INTERIOR OF SNOW SHED, SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Beyond Chico, northward,
the scenery becomes rapidly
more rugged, until we plunge
into the Siskiyou range, and
apparently become tangled up,
so tortuous is the way. Time
and again the road overlaps
itself in winding up the steeps,
leaps across yawning chasms
on lofty steel bridges, and
dashes into tunnels that for a
while appear to lead directly to
the center of the under-world.
But on every side, where daylight
reveals the turbulent landscape,
there is much to excite
wonder and to lend surprise. A hundred miles before we come abreast of Mount Shasta, the sunlighted head of that mammoth peak glints
and glistens with a weirdly grand effect upon the admiring eyes of approaching travelers. There it stands, apparently shifting from one
side of the track to the other as we wind around among the gorges and creep up the slopes, but always a chief among mountains and
commander among the clouds. Sissons is the nearest station to the giant peak, and here we stopped to make some photographs and gather
information. The base of Shasta is exceedingly broad, covering as it does a circumference of seventy-five miles, and its hoary head is lifted
up 11,000 feet above the surface,
and 14,450 above the sea.
The greatest wonder, however,
is not in the mountain’s height
or size, but in the fact that it is
an extinct volcano, whose crater
is nearly one mile in diameter
and 1,500 feet deep. On one
side there is a rift, resembling a
broken piece from the rim of a
bowl, through which the sea of
lava that boiled and seethed in
this devil’s caldron many centuries
ago, evidently broke and
poured a burning flood into the
valley, and overflowed a large
district of country. This may
have been done in one of its expiring
throes, for certainly there
are no evidences that the volcano
has been in activity within
the past five hundred years.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is a cold gray
light upon this mountain in
winter mornings, that even to
look upon, sends a chill to the
very marrow, especially if the
snow-banner be flying; yet perhaps
at evening tide, when
twilight shadows have darkened
the valley below, this vast
pyramid of hoar frost and storm-swept ridges is transformed into a great beacon light of glory, where the warm mellow light loves to linger;
where the richest halos of gold and crimson encircle it with their loving bands; where the last and best treasures of the declining sun are
poured out in a wondrous profusion, until it is driven by the night lavenders and grays beyond the horizon; then, the tranquil light of the
stars sends shining avenues of silver down its furrowed, hoary slopes; soon there comes out from behind the night, first a faint flash of radiant
silver that gleams across the sky and dims the light of the stars, the higher peaks are aflame with St. Elmo fire, and slowly from spire to
spire, and from ridge to ridge, this incandescent flood sweeps on until the whole mountain glows and gleams with a light supernatural.”</p>

From this point it presents the appearance of a broad triple mountain, the central summit being flanked on the west by a large crater, whose rim is 12,000 feet high. The highest point in the centre is 14,442 feet. Shasta, as a whole, is the cone of an immense extinct volcano, rising with a single sweep from the base to a height of 11,000 feet.

<p>SACRAMENTO CAÑON, CALIFORNIA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Another particularly wonderful natural attraction on the line of this road are the Chalybeate Soda Springs, which furnish an
unfailing supply of mineral water, equal to the best that is bottled for the bar and picnic trade. When taken fresh from the spring, it has
the appearance of champagne, which, indeed, it resembles in taste; and so strongly charged is the water with carbonic acid gas, that it will
hold its flavor as long as any
extra-dry wine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near these remarkable
springs are the Mossbrae Falls,
which come sliding over the
lofty banks of the Sacramento
in sheets of limpid water that
look like glass, and have a
spread of nearly half a mile.
The fall varies in height from
fifty to one hundred feet, but
is surprisingly beautiful at
every point.</p>

<p class='c011'>After crossing Siskiyou
Mountains, the road descends
by a spiral way until it strikes
Rogue Valley, thence through
Grant’s Pass and gains the
Willamette Valley, which is a
level expanse of exceedingly
great fertility. The ride to
Portland over the rest of the
way is interesting, not so much
for the diversity of scenery, as
for the scenes of thrift and prosperity
which lie on both sides,
for the country is a very Eden
of productiveness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Portland, which lies near
the junction of the Columbia
with the Willamette River, is
one of the handsomest cities on earth, situated in one of the most attractive regions that the eye of the traveler ever gazed upon. From a
high point in the western suburbs, gained by a cable-road, a view may be had greater than that which Quarantaria offers. To the west
broadens the united waters of the two rivers, floating the commerce of this vigorous city to and from the sea. And in the clear atmosphere
to the east rise like giants out of a plain the lofty peaks of Hood, St. Helen’s, Adam’s and Ranier, upon whose brows eternal snows beat
with fury, and where clouds often settle to rest themselves for a fresh flight. Still beyond are the whitened crests of the Cascade range,
reveling in a mad confusion of effort to gain the skies; and wandering through a maze of forest, mountain and gorge, are the Columbia and
Willamette, like two long ribbons of burnished silver flung down by the gods to mark a way to wealth.</p>

<p>MOSSBRAE FALLS ALONG THE SACRAMENTO.—<span class="multicaption">These falls are in the Sacramento River, not far from Upper Soda Springs in northern California. They vary in height from fifty to one hundred feet, and have a spread of nearly half a mile up and down the river. The water is so clear and limpid that it resembles great sheets of glass as it pours over the banks, producing a scene of indescribable beauty.

<p>SODA SPRINGS, SACRAMENTO CAÑON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Willamette River is particularly beautiful in its upper course, where the scenery is almost a counterpart of that along the
Rhine, whereas the Columbia becomes charmingly interesting almost from its mouth, and increases in grandeur as the ascent is made.
Indeed, it may with truth be
declared that scenically considered,
the Columbia is the most
delightful river that is known
to modern geographers. The
shores are mountainous, at times
shooting up perpendicularly to
amazing heights, and composing
miles of solid walls; then
again dropping away in level
stretches covered with forests
of pine, spruce and fir-trees; or
revealing cañons down which
plunge turbulent tributaries,
and giddy waterfalls dancing
out of the sky and falling in
fleecy sheets so far as to dissolve
its vapor. Some of the
shore walls are of basalt, of fantastic
shapes and brilliant with
coloring; and not infrequently
solitary columns of very great
height are seen standing like
sentinels along the water edge,
such as Castle Rock, Rooster
Rock, and the columnar cliffs
of Cape Horn.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Dalles of the Columbia
are as famous as the palisades
of the Hudson, while in fact
they are much more wonderful,
and well worth a trip of thousands of miles to see. They occupy about fifteen miles of the river between Celilo and Dalles Station, and
are only 130 feet wide, whereas above and below, the bed of the stream is from 2,000 to 2,500 feet wide. As the river is swollen to
extraordinary proportions by rain freshets and the melting of snow in the spring-time, it is not a remarkable thing that during such flood
periods the water rises suddenly in this narrow cleft as much as sixty, and even seventy feet. The river itself very commonly rises as much
as twenty-five feet, even at its widest places, and hence we may imagine what a raging torrent it becomes; but at low-water the Dalles are
a succession of cascades of the most beautiful proportions, rolling in sheets of clearest water, over terraces of stone as regular as though they
had been laid by the hand of a mason.</p>

<p class='c011'>The region of Oregon near Portland, and along the Columbia, is rich in scenery of the most beautiful and picturesque character. Far in the distance loom snowy
peaks, and the clouds, trees and mountains are reflected in the clear water as in a mirror. Among the most picturesque of all the scenes of this locality are Multinomah
Falls, near the railway station of the same name. The water plunges down the astonishing distance of 700 feet, breaking into a ribbon of glittering spray as it falls. A little
to the right of the main falls, as seen in the photograph, is another tiny little one, so modest as scarcely to be observed, but loved and admired by tourists equally with its
larger sister.</p>

<p>WILLAMETTE FALLS, OREGON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From the Dalles down, the river plows its way through the Cascade Mountains, which on either side appear like towered battlements,
while waterfall after waterfall pour their tribute down the mountain sides to swell the on-flowing stream. Twelve miles below is
Memaloose Island, which is the ancient burial place of the Chinook Indians, who held it as a sacred spot, guarded, as they maintained, by
spirits of the river. The gorge proper begins twenty miles below the Dalles, and thirty miles further are the cascades, but between these
there is an incomparable panorama
of grandeur and beauty,
for the river is broken by many
giant bowlders, around which
the swift-rushing water is lashed
into fury. Still further below,
and around the next interval of
six miles, where portage by rail
is necessary, the scenery
becomes even more exquisite,
with islands that are so wind-swept
as to be entirely devoid
of vegetation, while scores of
lovely falls line the river, such
as Horse-Tail, a clearly defined
stream that pours down a height
of 200 feet, and Multinomah, a
strip, or veil, of spray, that falls
850 feet perpendicularly. There
are, besides these, others almost
equally surprising and beautiful,
such as Bridal Veil and
Oneonta, both of which dash
down over cliffs brilliantly
green with mosses, and are
reflected in their full length in
the crystalline river into which they fall, while the soft coloring of bluest sky and blending tints of emerald pines give to the scene an
intimation of fairy-land. Just below these, in stately procession, are Castle Rock, that shoots up 1,000 feet; Rooster Rock, a dizzy pinnacle
of stone amid-stream; Cape Horn, frowning from shore, and lifting its brow 500 feet above the river, while the Pillars of Hercules, twin
shafts of basalt, grand, massive and sublime, act as guardians before this watery realm of wonderland.</p>

Here the river passes through the heart of the Cascade Mountains, and the turbulent waves roar through the narrow channel, confined on either side by cliff-like walls of rock, often rising to the height of 1200 feet or more. At Cascade Locks there are fierce and whirling rapids, with a fall of forty feet, the entire river dashing down twenty feet at a single bound. For a distance of five miles the river is a seething caldron of foam, too dangerous for any kind of navigation to be attempted. The photograph gives a splendid bird’s-eye view of a portion of the Dalles.</span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Twenty-five miles from the palisades, and reached by means of comfortable stages over a good road, is Mount Hood, one of the
loftiest, as well as the most impressive, dead volcanoes to be found anywhere in the world, of which it has been written: “The view from
the summit of Hood is one of unsurpassed grandeur, and probably includes in its range a greater number of high peaks and vast mountain
chains, grand forests and mighty rivers, than any other mountain in North America. Looking across the Columbia, the ghostly pyramids
of Adams and St. Helens, with their connecting ridges of eternal snow, first
catch the eye; then comes the silent, lofty Ranier, with the
blue waters of Puget Sound and the rugged Olympia Mountains for a background; and away to the extreme north (nearly to H. B. M.’s
dominions), veiled in earth mists and scarcely discernible from the towering cumuli that inswathe it, lies Mount Baker. Looking south
over Oregon, the
view embraces
the Three Sisters
(all at one
time), Jefferson,
Diamond Peak,
Scott, Pit, and,
if it be a favorable
day, and you
have a good
glass, you may
see Shasta, 250
miles away. The
westward view is
down over the
lower coast
range, the Umpqua,
Calapooya,
and Rogue River
Mountains, with
their sunny upland
valleys, and
away out over
the restless
ocean. In the
opposite direction,
across the
illimitable plains
of Eastern Oregon,
to the Azure
Blue Mountains;
down, almost to
the foot of this
mountain, ‘rolls the Columbia,’ through the narrow, rugged gorge of ‘The Dalles,’ 250 miles of its winding course being visible. The
entire length of the great Willamette Valley, with its pleasant, prosperous towns and gently-flowing river, its broad, fertile farms, like rich
mosaics, with borders of dark-green woodlands, is spread out in great beauty under the western slope of Mount Hood.”</p>

<p>ONEONTA GORGE, COLUMBIA RIVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Columbia is not only famed for its peerless scenery,
and as being a main artery in Pacific coast commerce, but it is
equally noted as affording the most profitable salmon fishing in
the world. Hundreds of people are engaged in this industry,
and vast wealth has been amassed by some of the large companies
who run immense canneries in connection with the
fisheries. At certain seasons the fish appear in such prodigious
numbers, on their way up stream to the spawning grounds,
that they almost crowd each other out of the water. The most
successful way of taking the fish at such times is by the use of
wheels attached to the end of a scow, which, being set in
motion, scoop them up and deposit them in the boat, and so
rapidly that thousands are thus taken in an hour. The fish
continue their run up-stream as far as the water will allow, and
so determined are they that they perform many amazing feats
to gain the headwaters, crossing shoals, darting through the
swiftest cascades, and even leaping up and over falls of considerable
height. The Indians, familiar with the instincts of the
salmon, in the season take great numbers by means of spears,
which they cast with astonishing accuracy. A chief fishing
place is Salmon Falls, where the river is a mile wide and
plunges over a wall fully twenty feet high, extending from
shore to shore. Notwithstanding this height, the salmon
gather in the whirlpool below and suddenly dart up the falls
like a flash of light, their tails waving with such rapidity that
they are carried up and over the falls. It is while making
these leaps that the Indians spear the fish, killing immense
numbers, not only for food, but through sheer wantonness, at
times fairly filling the river with the dead beauties.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>A SIDE-TRIP TO CRATER LAKE.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Before leaving San Francisco, one of our photographers
expressed a very great desire to visit Crater Lake, one of the
most remarkable bodies of water on the face of the earth, and
so urgent were his pleadings, that it was decided he should
make the trip, while the rest of the party continued on to
Portland, to perform the work of photographing points of
interest thereabouts, and on the Columbia River. In pursuance
of this arrangement, he left us at a station called Medford,
on the Southern Pacific Railroad, and from that place rode
over to Jacksonville, capital of Jackson county, Oregon, a distance of five miles, to make his preparations for a journey to the lake.
Jacksonville is a town of about 1,000 inhabitants, off the railroad, but on the military road that leads to Crater Lake, some seventy miles
distant northeast, and thence to Fort Klamath. It was not difficult to procure necessary conveyance, but for safety it was deemed advisable
to pack the cameras on a donkey, probably the surest-footed and most reliable animal that ever submitted back to a burden. Three men
accompanied our photographer, with one road-wagon and a light buggy, hauling the necessary camping outfit, and being well prepared,
the party started from Jacksonville on the 15th of April, 1891. The road follows Rogue River the entire distance, along which is some
very beautiful scenery, and not
a few wild gorges, which were
photographed. There are a
number of post-offices on the
way, Deskins being the most
northern, beyond which, and
for nearly thirty miles, to the
lake, there is a wilderness of
mountain and cañon, unrelieved
by any signs of human habitation.
Crater Lake is in the
western part of Klamath
county, and is in the Klamath
Indian reservation, a region
that is distinctively volcanic,
diversified by lakes, marshes
and mountains, with the soil so
mixed with scoriæ that it is
harsh and unproductive. It
was not until noon of the second
day that the vicinity of the
lake was reached, approach to
it being indicated by a bank of
clouds that hung over one spot,
like a fog gradually lifting,
beneath which was manifestly
a large body of water. A suitable
camping place was soon
found, and the tent being set up and dinner disposed of, the work of exploring and photographing the lake was energetically begun.
Fortunately, the weather was propitious and the season favorable, for otherwise clambering over so rough a region with the precious burden
of delicate cameras would have been next to impossible. The snow falls to very great depths on the high ridge which surrounds the lake,
and spring rains are at times so heavy here that the precipitous sides are gashed deeply by the cataracts thus produced.</p>

<p>AMONG THE CLOUDS ON MOUNT HOOD.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Klamath Indians have many traditions about the lake, one of which is to the effect that in earlier years it was the haunt of
great numbers of water-devils, who watched its shores and drew into its mysterious depths all luckless persons who ventured near its banks.
For this reason it was not until recently that any Indian could be prevailed upon, by the promise of however great a reward, to approach
near the lake, though they were glad to guide travelers to its vicinity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first sight of this marvelous body of water excites unbounded awe and immeasurable wonder. The surface is 6,250 feet above
sea level, but notwithstanding this great elevation, it is enclosed by cliffs that rise from 1,000 to 2,000 feet, and the greater part are
vertical. At times, viewed from the summit of the walls, both the skies and mountainous surroundings are mirrored in the unrippled
surface of the lake, until it is really difficult to distinguish the line of separation between the real and the reflection.</p>

<p class='c011'>Crater Lake is egg-shaped, being seven miles in length by six in breadth, and in the southwest portion there is an island which rises
out of the water to the amazing
height of 850 feet. But
this is not its only remarkable
feature, for the island is circular
in shape, with a scant
vegetation on its sides, and in
the center is a crater known as
the Witch’s Caldron, which is
100 feet deep and nearly 500
feet in circumference. Here,
then, we have the now smokeless
chimney of what was once
an active volcano, out of which
poured a fiery mass that ran
down the steeps and became
congealed in the lake, for the
base of the island is of ashes
and vitrified rocks, evidencing
the intense heat which once
prevailed within and around it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The salmon fisheries of the Columbia River constitute one of our most important northwestern industries, and the fish-wheels
used in catching the salmon are to be seen at many points, lending a degree of life and activity to what would otherwise, in many
instances, be an uninspiring view.—The surface of Crater Lake is 6250 feet above the level of the sea, and yet it is enclosed by cliffs
that rise from 1000 to 2000 feet higher still. This will give some idea of the imposing grandeur of the scene. Many of these cliffs
are perpendicular from the water’s edge to their summits, so that a stone dropping from the top will fall of its own weight into the
lake more than a thousand feet below.</p>

<p>GROTTO IN CRATER LAKE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>On the shore, north of
Wizard Island, is a rock that
juts up 2,000 feet, and its side
is so perpendicular that one
standing upon its summit can
drop a stone into the lake,
nearly half a mile beneath. It
is not at all surprising that this wonderful lake should be the subject of much superstitious dread among the Klamaths, and among the
traditions and tales which these simple Indians tell is the following: A long time ago, a band of Klamaths, while hunting deer, which
have always been abundant in this region, came suddenly upon the lake. They had often traveled over the same district, without
discovering either lake or depression, and now, suddenly beholding so large a body of water, surrounded by towering walls, they perceived
in it the work of the Great Spirit, but were not able to interpret its significance. All but one of the Indians fled in terror from the place,
but the bravest determined, if possible, to ascertain the wishes of the Great Spirit, and, accordingly, he proceeded to the very brink of the
lofty walls, and there built a camp-fire, to wait the Spirit’s
call. Long he waited, until weary at last he lay down and
slept; while he was thus sleeping he had a vision and heard
mysterious voices, but he was not able to understand what
was said, or to clearly discern the shape or appearance of
his unearthly visitors. But as often as he slept he perceived,
in his dreams, the indistinct forms of what half-appeared to
resemble human bodies, and plainly heard voices, but they
were strange tongues. Charmed by these visions, the Indian
remained, day after day, and week after week, upon the precipice
of the lake, leaving his camp-fire only to slay a deer for
subsistence, until at length he descended to the surface of the
lake and bathed in its crystal and mysterious waters. Instantly
he felt his strength marvelously increased, and thereafter saw
that the weird visions of his dreams were inhabitants of the
lake, having human forms, but whether they were spirits of
good, or devils of evil, he knew not. Familiarity, however, at
length made him careless, and on one occasion he caught a fish
in the lake, with the intention of using its flesh for food, but
no sooner had he killed the fish than a thousand water-devils
rose up out of
the depths of
the lake, and,
seizing the unfortunate
brave
carried him
through the air
to the top of
the cliffs. Here
they cut his
throat and cast
his body headlong
into the
water, 2,000
feet below,
where it was devoured
by the
angered devils.</p>

<p>A FISH-WHEEL ON COLUMBIA RIVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Klamath
Indians
believed that the water-spirits had not fully satisfied their revenge by this one bloody act, but would similarly destroy any Indian who had
the temerity to approach the lake.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the base of a cliff on the south side of the lake stands a solitary rock, probably 100 feet high by 200 in length, and nearly the
same in breadth, that, while not seen by the present generation of Indians, it is nevertheless known to them, and is a special object of
superstitious dread.
They consider it as a
peculiarly ferocious
monster, but are unable
to describe its characteristics.
It stands in the
lake, entirely alone, and
about fifty yards from
shore. Standing on the
cliffs, about five miles
to the west and looking
across the lake, this
strange rock is plainly
visible in the sunlight,
its rugged peaks reaching
aloft, giving it the
appearance of a full-rigged
ship at anchor.
Should a cloud pass
before the sun as the
shadow strikes the rock
it will recede from view
as effectually as though
it had ceased to exist.
This illusion has
prompted some one to
call the rock the Phantom
Ship.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another equally
interesting optical illusion
is thus described by
W. G. Steel, F.A.G.S.,
who made an exploration of the lake with a corps of United States surveyors: “One day while at work on the lake, my attention was called
to what seemed to be a tall, full-bearded man standing on the southern portion of Llao Rock’s summit. One foot was placed a little forward
of the other and the knee slightly, but naturally bent, while before him stood a gun. His hands were clasped over the muzzle as he gazed
intently to the north. Just behind him stood a boy, apparently about fifteen years of age. They seemed entirely too natural not to be flesh
and blood, and yet persons at that distance would not be visible to the naked eye, as we were two miles out on the lake. Day after day, as
our work progressed, their position remained the same, and in the absence of a better excuse, we decided them to be trees.</p>

<p>GREEK CHURCH AT JUNEAU, ALASKA.—<span class="multicaption">The prevailing religion among the natives of Alaska is a mixture of the doctrines of the Greek Church, inculcated by missionaries from Russia, and the ancient totemism of the aborigines. The missionaries wisely concluded that it was better to convert the natives to Christianity, and bring them up to civilization by a gradual process, rather than attempt a sudden transformation; hence the singular combination of the rites of a ludicrous superstition with the beneficent teachings of the Man of Galilee. Mission churches exist at several points in the territory, one of which, a very picturesque building, is finely photographed on this page.</span></p>

<p>SUMMIT OF MOUNT SAINT HELENS, ABOVE THE CLOUDS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“It is hard to comprehend what an immense affair it is. To those living in New York City I would say, Crater Lake is large
enough to have Manhattan, Randell’s, Ward’s and Blackwell’s Islands dropped into it side by side, without touching the walls, or Chicago
or Washington City might do the same. Our own fair city of Portland, with all her suburbs, from City Park to Mount Tabor, and from
Albina to Sellwood inclusive, could find ample room on the bottom of the lake. On the other hand, if it were possible to place the lake,
at its present elevation, above either of these cities, it would be over a mile up to the surface of the water, and a mile and three-quarters to
the top of Llao Rock. Of this distance,
the ascent would be through
water for 2,000 feet. To those living
in New Hampshire, it might be said
the surface of the water is twenty-three
feet higher than the summit of Mount
Washington.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The shore of Crater Lake has
many remarkable indentations of
slender arms and beautifully formed
bays, and on one side there is a grotto
running back some thirty feet and
twenty feet inside, spanned by a graceful
arch about eight feet high, forming
an admirable shelter as well as a
curious alcove in the rock, where the
water is some twelve feet deep. The
lake itself measures a little more than
2,000 feet in depth in places, but
soundings show that there are peaks
below the surface representing cinder
cones, and which once evidently stood
high above the surface. The whole
lake is thus a reminder of mighty
forces and the relic of terrible convulsions.
What an immense affair it
must have been ages upon ages ago, when, long before the hot breath of a volcano soiled its hoary head, standing as a proud monarch,
with its feet upon the earth and its head in the heavens, it towered far, far above the mountain ranges, aye, looked far down upon the
snowy peaks of Hood and Shasta, and snuffed the air beyond the reach of Everest. Then streams of fire began to shoot forth, great seas of
lava were hurled upon the earth beneath. The elements seemed bent upon establishing hell upon earth and fixing its throne upon this
great mountain. At last its foundation gave away and it sank forever from sight. Down, down, down deep into the bowels of the earth,
leaving a great, black, smoking chasm, which succeeding ages filled with pure, fresh water, giving to our day and generation one of the
most beautiful lakes within the knowledge of man.</p>

<p>CATHEDRAL ROCK, ON COLUMBIA RIVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 class='c013'>AWAY TO THE NORTH, AND THENCE TO ALASKA.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Our trip up the Columbia, and along the Willamette as far as Willamette Falls, was delightful beyond any one’s ability to describe;
but though wonder succeeded
wonder, and kept us as under
a spell of enchantment, there
were other surprises in store
which were to hold our interest
and even add something to our
astonishment. Returning to
Portland, we might have
carried out our original resolution
to take the steamer at
that point direct for Alaska,
but we very wisely made a
change in our plans, by which
we proceeded by rail to Vancouver,
stopping en route,
however, to continue our work
of photographing mountains,
valleys and glaciers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tacoma was our first
stop after leaving Portland,
and a very beautiful city it is,
admirably and commercially
situated at the head of navigation
in Puget’s Sound. Mount
Tacoma appears to be in the
very front-yard of the city, so
wonderfully clear is the air,
though in fact it is forty
miles away. The Sound is
astir with the white wings of
sailing vessels, and streaked with the black trails of ocean-going steamers, while the blue waters are begirt with the dark green of heavy
forests, making a picture of almost incomparable beauty. There is romance in the very air, a kind of dreamy vision of the long ago, when
this was the happy land of the Siwashes, who come before us again in the pretty legends which linger still upon the lips of this almost
extinct tribe. They tell us of a Saviour who once came to them, riding in a copper canoe, out of the bleak desolation of the icy north, and
who, first calling all the tribes together, preached to them the gospel of unselfish service and righteousness. He taught them the beatitudes,
and was first to declare that man was possessed of an undying spirit, which lived forever, in pleasure or pain, according to the measure of
his deserving. The Indians listened with reverent attention until this Saviour exhorted them to live in brotherly unity, one with another,
and to avoid all strife, for he who shed human blood would feel the vengeance of the Great Spirit. This teaching so incensed the war-like
tribes that they seized the Saviour and nailed his body to a tree, where it remained nine days. Then behold, there came a great storm of
hail, accompanied by thunders
that rent the earth and leveled
the forests. In the midst of
this mighty cataclysm of natural
forces the Saviour appeared
again, resurrected unto full life,
and speaking to the winds and
the thunders, in an instant the
storm was hushed, and a great
peace and burst of sunshine
bathed the earth. After this
the reincarnated Saviour
renewed his preaching and continued
to teach immortality for
many weeks, until at last he
ascended to the skies in a cloud.</p>

<p>INDIAN BURIAL HOUSES, NEAR THE TOWN OF JUNEAU, ALASKA.—<span class="multicaption">It is a religious custom among the Indians of Alaska to build houses, more or less pretentious according to the means of the surviving relatives, over the graves of their deceased friends. These houses are then suffered to fall into decay with the lapse of time, like family cemeteries in our own land, until in many instances the ghastly remains are exposed to view. The cemetery photographed on this page is evidently a new one, judging by the neat appearance of the little houses. There is really a beautiful sentiment in this custom, notwithstanding its origin among a heathenish and superstitious people.</span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>These same Indians have
also a tradition of the deluge,
which bears a striking similarity
to the Genetic account.
They assert that many thousands
of years ago a great rain
fell upon the earth, such as was
never before or since known;
that such torrents of water were
poured out of the sky that the
world became a universal sea,
with no spot of dry land anywhere
visible. In this all-prevailing
flood every human being
perished except one man who took refuge on Mount Tacoma. As the water rose, he was driven higher and higher, until at last he reached
the summit; but still the sea advanced; it covered the loftiest point of the mountain, then rose above his feet, his knees, and finally reached
to his waist, when, to prevent him from being swept away, the Great Spirit turned his feet to stone, and he thus became anchored on the
peak. Then the rain ceased, and the waters were gradually assuaged, but the man could not yet move from his position. At last the waters
were again within their beds, the fields bloomed, the forests put forth with new life, and the world became musical with song of bird and
the lullabies of flowing streams.
Then a profound sleep fell upon the
man, and while he slept the Great
Spirit took a rib from his side, and
from it made a beautiful woman.
When he woke his feet were no
longer stone, but strong with vigor,
and at once he started down the
mountain; but scarcely had he taken
the first step when he saw before
him the lovely woman who was given
to him for wife. The Great Spirit
now directed the couple to the foot
of Tacoma, where he had planted a
garden, and in this paradise he commanded
them to abide and replenish
the world.</p>

passage at Victoria, on the

vessel <i>Queen</i>, and
started upon a delightful voyage
to Alaska, that opalescent gem
in the frosted coronet of the far
northwest. The trip is a revelation,
a day-dream of indescribable
transports, a luxury
of blissful surprises. It is a
strange combination of ocean
and inland water travel, and
just enough of each to provide
all the pleasures of both, with
none of the monotonies or discomforts
of either. The route
is almost entirely land-locked
through channels of varying
width, among islands which
appear numberless, and as green
with prolific vegetation as the
shores of Killarney’s lakes.</p>

<p>UMATILLA INDIAN CAMP, OREGON.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>At places the channel narrows
and passes through walls
of very great height, and again
widens to many miles, but all
the while there are emerald
shores, and high-rising banks
over which tumble many beautiful
waterfalls, and still above
these, in the hazy backgrounds,
are snow-capped mountains.
Two hundred miles north of
Victoria is Nanaimo, the last
town with telegraphic connections,
and six hundred miles
beyond the steamer touches at Fort Wrangel, where the first contact with Alaska Indians is made, and interest at once centers in the curious
appearance and habits which they display. Passing thence through Wrangel Narrows the region of ice is reached, indicated by a few
straggling bergs that have become detached from the glacier that forms in a fiord called Thunder Bay, near the mouth of Stikeen River.
Then follows a view of the Coast Range, which is rent with icy cañons that glow and gleam with refractions of clear sunlight, until in
places they suggest the palace of Iris. Through this maze of mighty wonders the steamer plows her way to the town of Juneau, famous
not so much for its latitude as being the location of the largest quartz-mill in the world. Thence we proceeded through a labyrinth of
islands into Lynn Canal, which is considered to be the “most sublimely beautiful and spacious of all the mountain-walled channels of
the Alaska route.” The Auk
and Eagle Glaciers are displayed
on the right as you enter
the canal, coming with grand
effect from their far-reaching
fountains and down through
the forests. But it is on the
west side of the canal, near the
head, that the most striking
feature of the landscape is seen—the
Davidson Glacier. It first
appears as an immense ridge of
ice thrust forward into the
channel, but when you have
gained a position directly in
front, it is shown as a broad
flood issuing from a noble
granite gate-way, and spreading
out to right and left in a beautiful
fan-shaped mass, three or
four miles in width, the front
of which is separated from the
water by its terminal moraine.
This is one of the most notable
of the large glaciers that are in
the first stage of decadence,
reaching nearly to tide-water, but failing to enter it, send off icebergs. Davidson Glacier is on the left shore of Chilcat River, and very
near the Indian village of Chilcat, the northernmost point reached by the regular line of steamers. The place is of very little interest except
for its salmon canneries and other fisheries. Cod, herring and halibut are very plentiful, but all the streams thereabout abound with
salmon. Indeed, during certain seasons they are so numerous as to fairly choke the shallow rivers, and in places they may be scooped up
with shovels. From this point the steamer turns south to Icy Strait, then proceeds north again by that channel into Glacier Bay, whence
beyond to Mount St. Elias is the real ice-land of Alaska.</p>

almost semi-tropical is produced. This is shown to a considerable extent in the photograph of Indian River on this page.—The companion picture, with our photographer

<p>CAVE IN THE GREAT GLACIER, BRITISH AMERICA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Glancing for a moment at the results of a general exploration, we find that there are between sixty and seventy small residual glaciers
in the California Sierras. Through Oregon
and Washington, glaciers, some of them of
considerable size, still exist on the highest
volcanic cones of the Cascade Mountains—the
Three Sisters, Mounts Jefferson, Hood, St.
Helens, Adams, Tacoma, Baker, and others,
though none of them approach the sea.
Through British Columbia and Southeastern
Alaska the broad, sustained chain of mountains
extending along the coast is generally glacier-bearing.
The upper branches of nearly every
cañon are occupied by glaciers, which gradually
increase in size to the northward until the
lofty region between Glacier Bay and Mount
St. Elias is reached.</p>

<p class='c011'>The largest of the glaciers that discharge
into Glacier Bay is the Muir, and being also
the most accessible is the one to which tourists
are taken and allowed to go ashore and climb
about its ice-cliffs and watch the huge blue
bergs as with tremendous thundering roar and
surge they emerge and plunge from the majestic
vertical ice-wall in which the glacier
terminates.</p>

<p class='c011'>The front of the glacier is about three miles
wide, but the central berg-producing portion,
that stretches across from side to side of the
inlet, like a huge jagged barrier, is only about
half as wide. The height of the ice-wall above
the water is from 250 to 300 feet, but soundings
made by Captain Carroll show that about 720
feet of the wall is below the surface, while still
a third portion is buried beneath moraine material.
Therefore, were the water and rocky
detritus cleared away, a sheer wall of blue ice
would be presented a mile and a half wide and
more than a thousand feet high.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>SCUZZIE FALLS, NEAR NORTH BEND, BRITISH AMERICA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The number of bergs that become detached
from the glacier every twelve hours varies with
tide and weather, but generally a new one is
thus fresh born every six or seven minutes, and
so massive that the discharge may be heard
like thunder or cannonading two or more miles
away. When one of the fissured masses falls
there is first a heavy, plunging crash, then a
deep, deliberate, long-drawn-out thundering
roar, followed by clashing, grating sounds from
the agitated bergs set in motion by the new
arrival, and the swash of waves along the
beach. All the very large bergs rise from the
bottom with a still grander commotion, rearing
aloft in the air nearly to the top of the wall,
with tons of water pouring down their sides,
heaving and plunging again and again ere they
settle and sail away as blue crystal islands;
free at last after being held rigid as part of
the slow-crawling glacier for centuries. And
strange it seems that ice formed from snow on
the mountains two and three hundred years
ago, should after all its toil and travel in
grinding down and fashioning the face of the
landscape still remain so lovely in color and
so pure.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rate of motion of the glacier as has
been determined by Professor Reid is, near
the front, about from five to ten feet per day.
This one glacier is made up of about 200
tributary glaciers, which drain an area of about
a thousand square miles, and contains more ice
than all the eleven hundred glaciers of the
Alps combined. The distance from the front
back to the head of the farthest tributary is
about fifty miles, and the width of the trunk
below the confluence of the main tributaries is
twenty miles or more.</p>

<p class='c011'>Next to the Muir, the largest of the glaciers
enters the bay at its extreme northwestern
extension. Its broad, majestic current, fed by
unnumbered tributaries, is divided at the front
by an island, and from its long, blue wall the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>icebergs plunge and roar in one eternal storm, sounding on day and night, winter and summer, and from century to century. Five or six
glaciers of the first class discharge into the bay, the number varying as the several outlets of the ice-fields are regarded as distinct glaciers,
or one. About an equal number of the second class descend with broad, imposing currents to the level of the bay without entering it to
discharge bergs; while the tributaries of these and the smaller glaciers are innumerable.</p>

<p>FACE OF MUIR GLACIER, ALASKA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Mr. John Muir, the explorer of Muir Glacier, thus describes his visit to that wonderful ice-swept region: “The clouds cleared away
on the morning of the 27th, and we had glorious views of the ice-rivers pouring down from their spacious fountains on either hand, and of
the grand assemblage of mountains,
immaculate in their robes
of new snow, and bathed and
transfigured in the most impressively
lovely sunrise light I
ever beheld. Memorable, too,
was the starry splendor of a
night spent on the east side of
the bay, in front of two large
glaciers north of the Muir.
Venus seemed half as big as the
Moon, while the berg-covered
bay, glowing and sparkling
with responsive light, seemed
another sky of equal glory.
Shortly after three o’clock in
the morning, I climbed the
dividing ridge between the two
glaciers, 2,000 feet above camp,
for the sake of the night views;
and how great was the enjoyment
in the solemn silence between
those two radiant skies
no words may tell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The destructive effects of
glaciers and the extent of their
ravages have been made the subject
of many interesting essays
by distinguished scientists, but nowhere has it been so interestingly and understandingly treated as by Dr. Wright in the <cite>Edinburgh
Review</cite>, on the “Ice Age of North America.” The monograph, much abbreviated, is as follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not more than 10,000 years ago since the whole of North America and Northern Europe emerged from beneath a deluge of ice
which seems to have destroyed the aboriginal inhabitants as remorselessly as Noah’s flood.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The chipped flint implement-makers perished with their contemporaries, the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, and the sabre-toothed
tiger, and left the globe to be repeopled by the polished stone-working or Neolithic progenitors of its actual inhabitants. The gap
between the two races is conspicuous, and has not yet been archæologically bridged. A catastrophe is indicated; and a catastrophe by
water. This is the conclusion of science; how singularly it harmonizes with the biblical narrative is almost superfluous to point out.”</p>

<p>VILLAGE OF KASA-AN, ALASKA.—<span class="multicaption">It will doubtless be a surprise to many persons not familiar with the conditions of the Alaskan Indians to observe that their houses are usually quite substantially built of frame or wood. We generally think of Indians as living in wigwams or huts, but in the case of the Alaskans they were for many years previous to the purchase of that country by our government under the influence of Russia, and are therefore partly civilized and somewhat advanced in the modern ways of living. But they still retain their old superstition, as shown by the totem poles in front of their houses. These poles are carved and mounted with rude representations of birds, beasts and reptiles, which are intended to give notice to the public that the spirits of the deceased ancestors of the occupants of the houses have entered into the living counterparts of these rude carvings, and that any indignities offered to them will be vigorously and promptly resented.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>The destruction of the Antediluvians who
lived before the Ice Age set in was accomplished
much further back; the date 6,000 B. C. represents
the end of the Ice Age, not its beginning.
How it was that ice submerged the world no one
seems to be exactly able to say, but a great deal
of valuable information has been obtained by
the geological research of the present century.
Before this devastating deluge of ice set in—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Trees reigned without interruption, in
north temperate and Polar regions, throughout
the vast expanse of tertiary time. Palms and
cycads then sprang up in the room of oaks and
beeches in England; turtles and crocodiles
haunted English rivers and estuaries; lions,
elephants, and hyenas roamed at large over
English dry land. Anthropoid apes lived in
Germany and France, fig and cinnamon trees
flourished in Dantzic; in Greenland, up to
seventy degrees of latitude, magnolias bloomed,
and vines ripened their fruit; while in Spitzbergen,
and even in Grinnell Land, within little
more than eight degrees of the pole, swamp-cypresses
and walnuts, cedars, limes, planes and
poplars grew freely.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For some reason or other the temperature
gradually fell, and great glaciers forming in the
northern regions, the highlands of Canada and
the Arctic Circles, submerged Northern Europe
and reduced Canada and half of the United States
to the present condition of Greenland. Those
who see glaciers to-day can form little idea of
the enormous possibilities of semi-fluid ice.
Only in Alaska, where the Muir Glacier empties
itself into the Muir inlet at the rate of seventy
feet a day, can we form any idea of the glacier
as a destructive agency. This glacier empties two hundred million cubic feet of ice into the sea every day; that is to say, 45,000 tons of
ice fall into the water every minute in avalanches with detonations which sound like the booming of a cannonnade. The very earth seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>to tremble, and the sea boils and foams with the continual discharge of fresh icebergs. “From observations upon living glaciers,” says
Dr. Wright, “and from the known nature of ice, we may learn to recognize the track of a glacier as readily and unmistakably as we would
the familiar foot-prints of an animal.” By the effects of ice-grinding, rocks are smoothed and polished, rounded and mammillated. They
are, moreover, striated. “These may be called glacial hieroglyphics; glacial deposits are equally distinctive. They are of three different
kinds—ground moraine, terminal moraine, and erratic bowlders. The heights to which the ice-flood rose are frequently self-registered on
the mountains which once breasted its flow. They serve, in Dr. Wright’s phrase, as ‘glaciometers.’ Thus it has been learned that the ice was
a mile thick in New England and a couple of thousand feet thick in Pennsylvania. The date of the close of the Glacial Epoch in the United
States can scarcely, then, be
placed earlier than 6,000 B. C.
For it was, we repeat, the withdrawal
of the ice that set the
chronometer of the Falls going.
The Falls of Niagara, indeed,
constitute in themselves, in Dr.
Wright’s apt phrase, ‘a glacial
chronometer.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was this tremendous
agency of glacial action that
gave us Northwest America as
we have it at present. “The inexhaustible
fertility of the Far
West is an endowment from
vanished glaciers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The world to-day is very
different from what it was in
the old times. The mountains
stood higher and the glaciers
forming on their slopes
crumpled the earth in beneath
their weight. The earth-crust
was not strong enough to bear
the weight of its ice-armor.
About six million square miles
were covered with ice, varying
in thickness of half a mile to a mile. Taking it only at half a mile in height, the weight per square mile was no less than two thousand
million of tons. “And the whole of this enormous mass being extracted from the ocean, its differential effect in producing change of level
was doubled. The ice-cumbered land accordingly went down, like an overladen ship, until it was awash with the waves, and sea-shells
were deposited along coast-fringes above the drift. Then, as the ice melted, recovery ensued.” The whole article is full of interesting
and suggestive reading, and is an excellent example of a popular presentation of the results of scientific research.</p>

<p>DAWSON’S GLACIER, BRITISH AMERICA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The return trip was made down Chatham and Peril Straits to Sitka, the capital city of Alaska, situated on the Pacific shore of
Baranoff Island. The place has grown
very much in importance in the past
few years, though it has not increased
correspondingly in size. It is a considerable
harbor for whaling and sealing
vessels, that touch there for
supplies, and accordingly supports a
population that is largely American.
The natives, however, still continue
in considerable numbers, but contact
with English-speaking people is
rapidly civilizing them, and their
old-time characteristics are fast disappearing.
But in one particular they
exhibit small change, viz.: religion.
Long under the domination of Russian
influence and missionaries of the
Greek Church, it is not surprising that
the natives should continue in the
faith which was thus first established
among them. There are three Greek
churches in the city, all fairly well supported,
though the communicants are
content to worship in rather humble
edifices. But while adopting the
Greek faith, the native Indians generally
retain their ancient mortuary
customs; and among the interior
tribes particularly, witchcraft, or
Shamanism, and exorcism, still prevail.
Burial of bodies is very seldom
practiced among any of the Indians,
as preservation of their dead is a universal
desire. It is, therefore, a
common thing to see their cemeteries,
instead of earth-mounds and tombstones,
a collection of mortuary
houses, in which the dead are laid
with great care, concealed only by the
skins or blankets in which they are
wrapped, something after the manner of the
Sioux Indians. Thus disposed of, the dead
are long preserved in that cold climate, the
houses themselves often decaying before dissolution
of the bodies is far advanced. This,
however, applies to what may be called the
better class of natives. Among the interior
and poor people, it is the custom to remove
the body to some secluded spot, usually on a
bluff overlooking a river, and lay it upon the
ground. A shelter is made by building over
it a small conical-shaped structure of spruce
logs, and a tree near-by is stripped of its
branches and small pieces of cloth are tied to
it to mark the spot. The household utensils,
sled, and some of the weapons of the deceased
are left with him, should he be the head of
a family, and the place is tabooed thenceforth.</p>

It was the 15th of May when we returned to Victoria, and without any waste of time we proceeded to Seattle, and there made hasty
preparation to continue our work along the northern lines of road towards the east. A little change was made in our original plans,
by a brief diversion from the routes we had marked out, in order to view and take some pictures of the marvelous scenery along Fraser
River, on the line of the Canadian Pacific Railroad. This stream is as wide as the Ohio, but generally of great depth, and being
confined within perpendicular walls, often rising to a height of 500 feet, it is a rushing flood, too swift in places for the most powerful
steamer to make head against.
The road follows the bed of this
torrential stream for a distance
of 150 miles, through the Cascade
Mountains, and in sight
at times of the Okinagan Range.
Beyond these eastward are the
Gold, Selkirk and Rocky
Mountains, and in between and
about these are glaciers of extraordinary
proportions, which
in summer feed tearing cataracts
and plunging waterfalls,
and furnish nature pictures that
thrill the heart with wonder.
Beyond the valley of Thompson
River, where the Golden Range
begins, the scenery is quite as
grand, though scarcely so sublime
as that in the cañon of the
Fraser; but the mountains are
surprisingly beautiful, and
variegated with patches of
snow, clumps of evergreen, and
sheets of soft blue water that
invite the angler. Louise,
Agnes and Mirror lakes lie one
above the other, high up upon
the mountain sides, where they
are often hidden by clouds, and
are accordingly called the “Three Sisters of
the Sky.” Castle Mountain may be seen
from this point, which is only a few miles
from Banff, famous for its hot springs, and
for being the chief resort in the Canadian
National Park, with a hotel capable of accommodating
800 guests.</p>

imposing and attractive that our own

<p class='c011'>Had the time been at our disposal, we

the time. Indeed, while in San Francisco,
we were earnestly urged to visit the islands
with our cameras, so as to include them in
our Wonderland book; and to the other inducements
offered, we were presented with
some views of the Hawaiian palace, the palmetto
embowered walks, cocoanut groves, and
pictures of the charming native girls, which
latter was a particularly powerful persuasive.
But the islands, charming though they are,
do not belong as yet to the American domain,

<p>SNOW-SHEDS ON THE CANADIAN PACIFIC.</p>

<p class='c011'>Returning to Seattle, we proceeded directly
eastward again, by the Northern Pacific
Railroad, crossing for a third time the Cascade
Range and viewing again the white and sunlighted
crests of Mounts Hood, St. Helens,
Adams and Ranier. The route is along the
Yakima River, through charming scenery
all the way to Spokane Falls, where the
beauty of the landscape, as well as the might
and awfulness of the falls, arrested us for a
time. Palouse Falls is within nine miles of
the junction of the Snake with Columbia
River, and are a part of Palouse River, which,
after flowing through a deep cañon thirty
feet wide, pours over a precipice that is a
sheer height of 125 feet. The surrounding
rocks exhibit many unique forms, ranging in
terraces to a height of 2,000 feet, and then
assuming the shape of pinnacles, chimneys,
columns and needles, as if the region had one
time been the work-grounds of giant sculptors.</p>

<p class='c011'>Snake River is interrupted by enormous
falls, the most important of which are American
and Island Falls, the former having a drop
of thirty feet; being very wide before taking
the final leap, the river flows over a series
of ledges that break the water into cataracts.
Further up the stream, about fifty miles from
Shoshone Falls, are Lost Falls, which leap
down from a height of two hundred feet, and
then the river, of which they are a part, disappears
under the lava-covered earth, but
reappears again several miles beyond and
resumes its impetuous and erratic course.</p>

This city is a place of much importance, and
admirably situated near the Junction of Hell
Gate and Bitter Root River, a district of great
scenic beauty. Flathead Lake lies sixty
miles to the north, an emerald sheet of crystal
water reposing within a bed of lofty cliffs, and
belted in the center by a chain of wooded
islands, while its waters are discharged into
the Pend d’Oreille River, that dashes away
through deep gorges in tumultuous flow. Forty
miles from this picturesque lake are the Two
Sisters’ Cascades, which pour over the opposite
walls of a colossal amphitheater 2,000 feet
high, and then unite to journey through gorge,
over waterfall and across lovely meadows,
catching perfume and inspiration on their way
to the Pacific.</p>

<p class='c011'>The way thence from Missoula is over a
comparatively level stretch of country, until
just west of Helena the road strikes the Main
Divide of the Rocky Mountains, and to cross
this broken region it is compelled to pursue
a winding way.</p>

<p class='c011'>Helena is reputed to be the richest city of
its size in all the world, a claim well supported
by appearances, for while having probably
15,000 inhabitants, it has all the conveniences
of our largest cities, and in no other place of
equal population are the public buildings and
residences so magnificent and palatial. But
aside from its wealth and beauty, the place is
the center of a region as remarkable for its
scenic attractions as for its silver mines.
Eighteen miles north of Helena is the cañon
of Little Prickly Pear, where precipitous walls
rise to a varying height of 500 to 1,000 feet,
and are gorgeously colored by strata of different
formations, blending with hues of trees,
shrubs, and vines that tenderly cling to their faces. Near-by is the portal through which the headwaters of the Missouri go madly
careening, making a deep roaring sound as they dash between walls 1,000 feet high. Atlantic Cañon is only three miles further down the
river, and next in quick succession appears the Bear’s Tooth, two monoliths that may be distinctly seen from Helena, twenty miles away.</p>

<p>FRONT VIEW OF MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS—CLEOPATRA AND JUPITER TERRACES.—<span class="multicaption">The chief wonders in Yellowstone National Park are the geysers, and the limestone formations such as are shown above. These terraces are formed by exuding water carrying a heavy solution of travertine, which is deposited in the most remarkable shapes when coming in contact with the air. This deposit is semi-crystalline, often resembling snow-banks, and as the process of hardening goes on in circular rims, basins are left which hold the water, and reflect in a myriad of hues the sky and surroundings.</span></p>

<p>CAÑON OF MISSOURI RIVER, NEAR GREAT FALLS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Montana Central and Great Northern Railroad convey travelers over a good road eighty miles further, to the Falls of the
Missouri, three in number, which are scattered over a distance of twelve miles, where the river flows through a cañon with vertical walls
200 to 500 feet high. We first meet a cascade called Black Eagle Falls, where the entire river drops over a ledge twenty-six feet high, a
precursor of the more terrible
waterfalls that are
to come. The next one
to appear in view is
Rainbow Falls, where the
river, 1,200 feet wide,
hurls itself down a perpendicular
descent of fifty
feet. Six miles further
down are the Great Falls,
that have a leap of ninety
feet, and whose terrible
roaring can be heard a
dozen miles away. At
this point the river has a
volume greater than the
Mississippi, but is narrowed
to 300 feet by walls
200 feet high. An island
divides the rushing
waters, the half next to
the right bank dashing
down with such tremendous
effect that clouds of
spray are sent 200 feet
high, which, struck by
bright sunbeams, are converted
into rainbows, or
at times glow with prismatic hues like giant soap-bubbles. That part of the stream flowing to the left passes over a succession of ledges,
forming a magnificent cataract of fleecy foam, 200 feet in width and 90 feet in perpendicular elevation. But though these are the
principal falls, there are twelve others within a distance of ten miles, having a total descent of 400 feet, and these interruptions in the
channel continue, though in a lesser degree, as far down as Fort Benton, which is the head of navigation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The country east of Helena, along the line of the Northern Pacific, presents no variation of apparently boundless prairie land, until
the Bad Lands of Northern Dakota are reached, which will be hereafter described. One hundred and fifty miles east of the city, however,
is the town of Livingston, at which point Yellowstone Park visitors change cars to a branch line that runs fifty miles due south to Cinnabar,
which is within a mile of the Wyoming State line, and three miles from the northern boundary of the National Park. We are now upon
the borders of the most wondrous region of the earth, the curiosities of which we will now attempt to briefly describe, though words seem
to lose their significance when they are used to portray the marvels that exist in this real wonderland.</p>

<p>RAINBOW FALLS, GRAND FALLS, MONTANA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>At Cinnabar, tourists take the stage for a seven miles’ ride to Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel, which is the first and principal hostelry
within the park. This ride prepares the visitor for remarkable surprises, for it is through an erratic district of soaring pinnacles, dizzy
walls and chaotic formations,
stranger and more weird than
the gate-way that Cerberus
guarded. Away up on the apex
of the first tall spire of stone
that has broken away from the
cañon walls of Gardiner River,
is seen an eagle’s nest, an aerie
so lofty that the clouds play
about it; so far-reaching skyward
that it is tipped with the
waking beams of sunlight before
day, and is bright with lingering
rays when evening shades
have descended. By aid of
glass the eagle may be seen
demurely surveying the world,
or in her absence the straining
necks of her ambitious brood,
watching the neighboring crags
for their royal parent’s return.
Nothing that I saw in Yellowstone
Park impressed me more
than this nest of eagles in the
azure depths of that perilous
peak.</p>

<p class='c011'>This great National
Park is a volcanic plateau some
10,000 feet above sea level, and embraces a territory fifty-five by sixty-five miles, or 3,575 square miles. It was first visited by John Colter,
an attaché of the Lewis and Clarke exploring expedition in 1806, but it was not until nearly fifty years later that stories told of the region
by old trappers and hunters were verified by a visit of members of the Geologic Survey. In 1880 it was made a National Park, since which
time it has been under the immediate control of the Secretary of the Interior, who appoints a superintendent with headquarters at the
Mammoth Hot Springs, and polices the park with a company of cavalry, whose principal care is the protection of game. So faithfully has
this duty been executed that the park now abounds with deer, buffalo, elk, bear, and a few mountain lions, besides a great abundance of
small game and water-fowl. Upon alighting from the stage at Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel, the first objects that attract the interest of
visitors are the pink terraced springs and Cap of Liberty, which are in the front-yard, so to speak. The springs, fifty in number, cover an
area of 170 acres and by a constant deposition of carbonate of lime have built
up, terrace upon terrace, a mound fully 200 feet high.</p>

<p>LITTLE JUPITER TERRACE.—<span class="multicaption">The different terraces of the Yellowstone Park cover an area about two miles square. They have the appearance of a frozen cascade, so beautifully scalloped and adorned with a kind of bead work, that the beholder stands amazed and filled with inexpressible admiration. The water flowing over these terraces is so transparent that it is like glass, and the pools below hold the reflection of the sky while mirroring the white crystalline formations, surpassing all art, and more beautiful than anything which can be conceived.</span></p>

<p>SLUICE-BOX CAÑON, NEAR GREAT FALLS, MONTANA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The springs have their source somewhere within an active volcanic
belt, and thus heated by internal fires they pour out their waters at a temperature
of 112° to 163° Fahrenheit, which, acting upon the soft limestone,
dissolves and converts it into what geologists call <i>travertine</i>, a semi-crystalline
deposit that quickly hardens upon coming in contact with the
air. When first observed, the terraces resemble a snow-bank, but by other
writers they have been compared to the terminal front of a glacier, and again
like a foaming cascade suddenly turned into stone. Streaks and patches of
red, yellow and green seen upon the white slopes mark the course of overflowing
water, while clouds of steam float lightly upward from the many
springs, but only to quickly disappear.</p>

<p class='c011'>There are in all eight well-defined benches, each with a more or less
level surface, and terminating with vertical fronts to the next terrace below.
Near the terraces, though on a bench of ground by itself, is Liberty Cap,
a pillar forty-three feet high and twenty feet in diameter, with sphinx-like
profile, the cone of a hot spring long since extinct. Close-by is a similar
monolith, not so tall, called the Devil’s Thumb, a name readily suggested
by the proximity of the springs to Pluto’s dominion, as some will have it,
and the gossip that Satan’s hand is in all the region thereabout.</p>

<p class='c011'>In wandering around the terraces the visitor is sure to have his surprise
quickened by the brightly-tinted basins, and the red and orange slopes
overflowed by the hot waters. These colors are due to the presence of
minute algæ, or water-plants, whose life is strangely enough supported by
the hot water and the lime held in solution; for investigation has disclosed
the astonishing fact that the chief work of these microscopic plants is the
separation from the water of the carbonate of lime, which they cause by
abstracting the carbonic acid.</p>

<p class='c011'>The view from these mammoth terraces is picturesque beyond comparison:
The dark and lofty summit of Sepulchre Mountain shows its drowsy
head near-by on the north; while the upper valley of the Yellowstone, and
the jagged peaks of Snowy Range, are seen to the northeast, between Sepulchre
and the long face of Mount Evarts. In the southeast the eye dwells
pleasantly upon the distant view of Lava Creek and Undine Falls, with
many snow-white peaks, standing like sentinels around this wizard realm;
while Bunsen Peak keeps watch towards the south, its dark slopes making
an effective background to the white hills of hot spring deposit.</p>

<p>COATING SPRING TERRACE.—<span class="multicaption">This terrace affords perhaps a better example of the formation of these beautiful monuments of Nature than any of the others. The water is seen flowing gently over the succession of steps, and depositing the calcareous substances of which they are composed. The ground-work is snow-white, but reflected from this is every shade of scarlet, green and yellow, as brilliant as the brightest of our aniline dyes. The spectacle is dazzlingly beautiful, producing a scene that cannot perhaps be equaled elsewhere in the whole world.</span></p>

<p>ECHO CAÑON FALLS, IN ROCKY MOUNTAINS, NEAR MIDVALE, MONTANA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>When we turn from viewing the surrounding scenery and begin to examine particularly each separate formation, we find near the
center of this sublimated field a blue spring, brilliant as a sapphire, and clear as a diamond, with a deep and irregular rim all around it, as
if nature had made an effort to retain its beautiful waters. This spring is fifteen by twenty feet in area, and is in a state of constant
agitation. The sides and bottom of the basin are formed of pure white travertine, while the varying depths cause the water to appear all
shades between a deep peacock-blue and a light nile-green. Issuing at a temperature of 165°, the water contains a considerable amount of
gas, which escapes at the surface of the pool, thus causing the flow to rise in the form of a little dome, while a pulsating movement is
imparted which sends out waves that ripple across
the water and curl over the shallow rim of the
bowl, filling other basins along its course. These
terraced overflow basins, thus formed, are a most
striking feature of the springs. No description can
do justice to their beauty, for neither the delicate
fretwork of their walls, the frosted surface of the
glistening deposit, nor the brilliant colors of the
pools and rivers can be adequately described.</p>

<p class='c011'>In many places the overflow is in thin
sheets and little cascades, while yellow, sulphur-coated
threads of algæ are abundant, though they
do not impart their color to the water, for the
exquisite blues and greens of the hottest basins are
due solely to the varying depths of water. On the
other hand, the bright lemon, red and green shades
of the cooler pools are entirely vegetable in their
nature, and due to the presence of algæ lining the
basins and striping their outer walls.</p>

<p class='c011'>The upper basins are generally shallow,
because of the rapid deposit of lime, but this deposition
occurs after the overflow, thus forming what
is called the Marble Basins, after which, the water
being somewhat cooled, the deposit is slower.
Accordingly, we find that the lower slopes are
exquisitely fringed with slender stalactites and
pillars, forming the beautiful Pulpit Basins as shown
in the illustration.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Government has expended large sums of money in making roads through the most interesting sections of the park, and over
these we pursued a greater part of our way in reaching the places which we desired to photograph. A stage runs through the park, in
which visitors may make the tour in six days, but for manifest reasons we traveled by private conveyances, camping out as often as we took
quarters at the several hotels located at convenient distances along the route.</p>

<p>NATURAL CASTLE, SLUICE-BOX CAÑON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Leaving the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces, whose incomparable beauties must ever remain as a delightful remembrance, we traveled
southward by the Hoodoos, and entered the Golden Gate, where a part of the road is built over a cañon and another part is carved out of the
cliffs, along which there is a charm following every footstep. On the one
side rise precipitous walls, while on the other is a gorge of almost infinite
depth, through which plunges Gardiner River, broken and foaming with
cascade and waterfall. Beyond the gates there is a brief level, then
down again among fresh curiosities the route leads by the Devil’s Paint-Pots,
Crystal Spring, pretty Beaver Lake, and along a mountain base
covered with blasted pines. Then another ascent, until the altitude is so
great that we found snow in considerable patches as late as July 1st.
But besides the bubbling springs and sputtering sulphur vats, whose
locations were marked here and there in the distance by their streams of
vapor, our interest was chained by the obsidian cliffs on our left, a black
mountain of mineral glass that sparkled with unnatural lustre because of
the dusky background, while strewed about were broken bits that made
the spot resemble the remains of a glass factory.</p>

<p class='c011'>At every few paces we startled a woodchuck which, satisfying his
curiosity with a glance, quickly disappeared among the stones. Deer
were occasionally seen scampering through the dead pine forest, and as
we reached Beaver Lake two solemn blue cranes crossed our road and
tried to hide their brood in a patch of tall grass. The hoarse “konks”
of the cock, the thin “peeps” of the young, and the peculiar motions of
the hen in her great agitation, were extremely amusing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Twenty miles from Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel is the Norris
Geyser Basin, where we were entertained with our first view of the
spouting volcanoes throwing up streams of hot water and great volumes
of vapor. This is indeed the Devil’s Kitchen, for besides the hellish
aspect of boiling caldrons, the air is charged with those sulphurous fumes
that are said to certainly indicate his activity and immediate presence.
There is no sign of soil thereabout, for the surface is incrusted with a deep
deposit of lime, in which vents occur to allow the escape of gases and to
give intimation of the fiery furnace which is raging beneath our feet.
We counted eighteen geysers from the insecure position which we took;
the most of them, however, were infantile and irregular in their action,
sending up a shower of mud at occasional intervals, and then subsiding
to gather fresh force; but steam poured out continually, and when we
moved a little further south, the roar of Steamboat Geyser fell on our
ears. It, too, acted spasmodically; but every few minutes there was a
deep rumbling, followed quickly by a respiration, deep, powerful and
awful as the rush of a hurricane, then a regurgitation, as if the earth were
swallowing up again the gas and steam which she had poured out.</p>

<p>IN THE BELT VALLEY, NEAR GREAT FALLS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>On the brink of this infernal pit, distributed over a considerable
space, were transparent pools of water of the most brilliant hues, indigo, orange, carmine and emerald, down in whose depths are queer
formations of petrifying algæ, and bubbles that look like pearls. Near this beautifully colored and transparent spring is Mud Geyser, a
basin full of mush, that lazily sputters as though it were hung over a slow fire, awaiting the spoon of a tardy diner. There is another mud
volcano near Sulphur Mountain, the crater of which is thirty feet deep and twenty-five feet in diameter, and which is in a state of constant
ebullition, throwing up great quantities of mud and steam to a height of 200 feet, and at times shaking the mountain with its terrible
convulsions. Great as were the wonders which we saw in Norris Basin, it proved to be only the threshold of the colossal, the overpowering,
the awful sights which we were yet to
behold.</p>

<p class='c011'>The well-constructed roadway
leading south from the Norris Geyser
Basin is along the Gibbon River, by
Johnson Peak and Hot Springs, into
Gibbon Cañon, which, however, is distinguished
for its gracefully sloping
sides rather than for its cliffs and depths.
A little way to the west the cañon
becomes wilder, and just below Beryl
Spring is a high shelf in the river, over
which the rushing waters plunge in a
fall of ninety feet. But the descent is
gradual, so that instead of torrential
dash the waters, after breaking on the
sharp projections of the rock face, slide
into the river below and then speed away
to join Madison River, into which is
drained the overflow of the many active
geysers. Though not precipitous, Gibbon
Falls is a beautiful sheet of liquid
crystals, rolling down terraces and
ledges exquisitely colored by the presence
of different minerals, and in the
sunlight exhibiting a sheen and brilliance
almost equal to that of Yellowstone
Falls. The charm is enhanced
by deep coverts of pine that are reflected in the placidly-flowing stream above and below the falls, and by the castellated bluffs that confine
the waters. The prospect from the cañon walls is also delightful, for towards every point there is a lovely panorama of remarkable
diversity, including mountains, valleys, parks, rivers, and geysers, the latter showing themselves many miles north and south, while steam
from boiling caldrons rolls skywards and gathers in volume until immense cumulus clouds are formed that hang ominously above the
valley, or are drifted away to break upon the sides of the surrounding mountains.</p>

<p class='c011'>Continuing our trip southward through Gibbon Cañon and by Gibbon Falls, whence the landscape is more level, we came at length to
Fire-Hole Creek and the Lower Geyser Basin. We were now in the region of giant geysers, in the visible presence of the most terrible
manifestations of nature. In this pit of Acheron, this purgatory of ferment and explosion, covering an area of forty square miles, are
almost countless geysers, distributed in seven groups, as if banded in rivalry. One of these groups is near the center of the basin and has
one hundred orifices that spout steam and water, resembling from a distance an extensive manufactory. The most interesting feature of
the Lower Basin is Fountain Geyser, which throws a column of water twenty feet in diameter to a height of fifty feet, though it plays only
at intervals of many days. Near-by is
Monument Basin, so called from the formations
of every conceivable shape which
distinguish it. Evangeline Geyser is
another eruptive volcano that throbs and
thumps violently when in action, but never
casts up water more than a few feet above
the surface; it has a beautifully scalloped
rim, with small bowls of exquisite incrustations,
resembling some of the basins in
Mammoth Terraces. It is in the Upper
Basin, eight miles further south, however,
that the greatest of geysers are to be seen,
though the area covered is scarcely three
square miles, and the springs are less
numerous. In this region, very near to
Fire-Hole River, is a spot called Hell’s
Half-Acre, a designation peculiarly appropriate
by reason of the purgatorial wonders
which exist therein, and the activity with
which old Nick’s stokers stir the subterranean
furnaces. The largest geyser in
this fiery-haunted district, and indeed
much the largest in the world, is Excelsior
Geyser, which has a mouth two hundred
feet wide and has been known to cast up a
flood of water two hundred feet high,
carrying with it large stones rent from the
walls of its Plutonian caverns. Excelsior
displays its power at very rare intervals,
sometimes remaining quiet for years; but to our surprise and joy it was in a state of violent eruption during our visit, and thus gave us an
opportunity not only to see but to photograph its immensity and awfulness.</p>

<p>EXCELSIOR GEYSER IN ACTION.—<span class="multicaption">Excelsior is the largest geyser, not only in Yellowstone Park, but in the whole world. Its mouth is 200 feet wide, and it has been known to spout a volume of hot water 200 feet high and filling the entire space of its cavity, carrying with it large stones rent from the interior of the earth. Such displays of its power occur only at rare intervals, but fortunately it was in a state of violent eruption at the time of the visit of our photographing party, and they thus had an opportunity not only to see but to photograph this wonder of nature in its immensity and awfulness.</span></p>

<p>CUPID’S CAVE, MAMMOTH HOT SPRINGS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The most interesting, because always reliable, is Old Faithful Geyser, which throws up a stream of hot water six feet in diameter
130 feet high every fifty-seven minutes, and sustains the flow for a period of five minutes. The amount of water thus discharged every
hour is 100,000 gallons, or enough to supply a small river. The Bee-hive, located on the opposite side of the river, blows up a column of
water three feet in diameter to a height of 250 feet, and plays, generally, for fifteen minutes, but at intervals of twenty-four hours. The
Giantess is, for several reasons, the most interesting of all the 700 geysers within National Park. One may approach to the very brink of her
crater, which is twenty feet across, and look down one hundred feet into her hot throat and hear the fierce gurgling of water, but none is
visible until an eruption is about to occur. Then the sputtering increases, deep groans are audible, and a burst of steam is followed by a
discharge of water that shoots upward in a succession of jets. The first main column sent up reaches a height of sixty feet, through which
there are projected small
streams a foot in diameter to
a height of 250 feet, thus making
a magnificent display for
twenty minutes which nothing
artificial can ever rival.</p>

<p class='c011'>Giant Geyser is less pretentious
than the Giantess,
having a ragged cone that is
broken on one side, and
through a vent eight feet in
diameter a discharge is made
at irregular intervals, when a
stream of water is tossed to a
height varying from 90 to 200
feet, and the activity sometimes
continues for two or three
hours. Other geysers that
make fine displays are the Sawmill,
Turban, Grotto, Punch-Bowl,
Soda, Grand, Fan, and
Riverside, some of which are
never quiet, while others play
only occasionally. It has been
found by experiment that foreign
substances thrown into
some of these craters create
an agitation that frequently
results in eruptions; the introduction
of soap or lye is invariably
attended by some manifestation even in the quiet geysers, while the active ones are by this means made to flow again almost
immediately after an eruption has taken place.</p>

<p>OLD FAITHFUL, LOWER GEYSER BASIN.—<span class="multicaption">Old Faithful is the most interesting and popular of the many geysers in National Park, because it can be relied upon to give an exhibition regularly every fifty-seven minutes. At these intervals, with the regularity of the beating of a healthy pulse, it emits a stream of hot water six feet in diameter to a height of 130 feet, and lasting five minutes. The amount of water thus discharged every hour is estimated to be about 100,000 gallons, or enough to supply a small river. This has been going perhaps for centuries, and will doubtless continue for centuries to come.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>After two days spent among the Upper and Lower Basin Geysers, with our cameras in constant service, for the sun shone brightly,
we went a few miles further down to Lone Star Geyser, Hot Springs, and to the high lands above Grant’s Pass. From this latter point of
observation a magnificent view was had and photographs obtained of the Great Teton Mountains and Snake River Valley, which fill the
distance with lines of hazy grandeur. Turning then towards the east we crossed Norris Pass (8,350 feet altitude), and after twenty miles
of travel emerged from the forest and reached the Thumb of Yellowstone Lake, as it is called. This magnificent body of water is fifteen
miles wide by twenty-five in
length, and is a basin of wonderful
beauty, thus described
by Mr. Langford:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Secluded amid the loftiest
peaks of the Rocky Mountains,
possessing strange peculiarities
of form and beauty, this watery
solitude is one of the most
attractive objects in the world.
Its southern shore, indented
with long, narrow islets, not
unlike the frequent fiords of
Iceland, bears testimony to the
awful upheaval and tremendous
force of the elements
which resulted in its creation.
Islands of emerald hue dot its
surface, and a margin of sparkling
sands forms its setting.
The winds, compressed in
their passage through the
mountain gorges, lash it into
a sea as terrible as the fretted
ocean, covering it with foam.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In several places along the
shore, and even projecting
from the lake, are several boiling
hot springs, which flowing
with clear water holding lime
in solution, pyramidal cones are
thus built around their outlets,
giving to them the appearance
of ant-mounds when seen at a
distance. Professor Hayden
startles us with the statement
that he has caught fish from the ice-cold lake while standing on these mounds, and dropping them into the craters of hot water, had the
novel experience of cooking the fish without removing them from the hook.</p>

There are several hot springs cones in the lake, containing water that is constantly at the boiling point. This water is separated from the lake by the solid walls of the cone, so that a person feeling so disposed may catch fish from the lake, as shown in the photograph, and boil them in the hot spring without removing them from the hook or changing his position. We are glad to say that the man in the picture who is performing this cruel feat did not belong to our photographing party.</span></p>

Continuing our circuit of the park, we followed

<p>CRYSTAL CASCADE, 129 FEET HIGH.</p>
</div>

<p class='c011'>A short distance from the hotel is Mount
Washington, whose massive head is raised to
a height of 10,500 feet above the sea; but so
gradually sloping are its sides that an easy
roadway has been made to the summit, which
we ascended and from that lofty peak surveyed
the vast landscape that was in the field
of vision; and what a glorious panorama was
there presented! We were indeed upon the
topmost ridge of the Great Continental Divide,
with the whole world apparently at our feet.
Towards the far west and the distant south,
as the range makes a sharp curve, were the
high and snow-crested peaks of the Rocky
Mountains, among which we readily distinguished
the majestic Tetons, upon which the
sacred fires lighted by very ancient tribes of
Indians are said to be still burning. To the
northwest are the Madison and Gallatin
Mountains, dropping gracefully towards the
east until they form what appears to be the
western walls of Yellowstone Valley, speckled
with its hundreds of steam-vomiting springs.
The mountainous aspect of the western view
has its counterpart in the tumultuous landscape
which greets us on the east, for the
horizon is broken, and the blue sky pierced
by the Shoshone Range, which we follow
towards the north as far as Emigrant Peak,
as it thrusts its brazen front out of the
Snowy Range. Still further west we perceive
the outlines of the Stinking and Big
Horn River Valleys, running in a northwesterly
direction, past Fort Custer and
the tragic Custer battle-field, until they
merge into the Yellowstone Valley, two
hundred miles from the park. In the clear
depths of the far southwest we perceive a
glitter in the tenuous atmosphere, which
our glasses discover to us to be caused
by snow on the Wind River Mountain
peaks reflecting the brilliant sunlight.
This magnificent range, that leaps out of
the plains of Wyoming, and after running
one hundred miles disappears again in the
prairie, attains such a lofty altitude that
the Wind River Shoshone tribe regard it
as the crest of the world. And they have
a legend, borrowed from the Blackfeet, that
only one warrior ever reached the summits,
from which he was permitted to look
directly into the happy hunting grounds
and survey all the entrancing beauties of
that delectable land of happy spirits. But
if the distant prospect is pleasing, how
much more delightful is the wonder valley
that lies at our feet! Looking down from
our exceeding high eminence, we behold
with amazement the Grand Cañon of the
Yellowstone, a gigantic gash in the mountains
twenty miles in length, and watch the
play of enormous waterfalls that swell the
mighty chorus of nature.</p>

<p>GIBBON FALLS, YELLOWSTONE PARK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Descending from Mount Washington, we proceeded by the roadway through a deep forest of pines until presently we gained the
brink of a frightful chasm nearly 2,000 feet deep, over which the river poured in tremendous force and had a sheer drop of 140 feet. This
is the Upper Falls, and a grand nature-picture they compose. But the magnificence of the scene is mightily increased less than half a mile
below, where the cañon walls rapidly contract and another greater precipice has been formed. Here the mad waters take a violent tumble
of 350 feet, at Lower Falls, and are tossed up again in a mist that sometimes beclouds the valley. But recovering its force, the river plunges
on with renewed energy, as the
descent increases, until out of
the gloomy depths it again
emerges for one more final leap
of 150 feet, at Tower Falls.</p>

<p class='c011'>While the falls are of
extraordinary interest, they are
not more than the worthy accessories
of a cañon which, though
not the greatest, is in some
respects the most sublime of any
on the American continent. Mr.
Archibald Geikie, an English
scientist, has given the following
admirable description of Yellowstone
Cañon, admirable not only
for its graphic picturing, but also

The photograph presents a fine view from one of the most desirable points, but even a photograph, let it be ever so accurate, cannot give a true idea of the real grandeur of a scene like this. The width of the cañon varies from 200 to 500 yards, and the walls on either side rise to a height of 1200 to 1500 feet, the river winding its tortuous way and plunging over numerous waterfalls at the bottom of this tremendous crevice. The river is transparent as crystal, and reaches a depth of 300 feet at one point.</span></p>

<p>YELLOWSTONE RIVER, NEAR MUD GEYSER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Scrambling to the edge of
one of the bastions and looking
down, we could see the river far
below, dwarfed to a mere silver
thread. From this abyss the
crags and slopes towered up in
endless variety of form, and with
the weirdest mingling of colors.
Much of the rock, especially of
the more crumbling slopes, was
of a pale sulphur-yellow. Through this groundwork harder masses of dull scarlet, merging into purple and crimson, rose into craggy
knobs and pinnacles, or shot up in sheer vertical walls. In the sunlight of the morning the place is a blaze of strange color, such as one
can hardly see anywhere save in the crater of an active volcano. But as the day wanes, the shades of evening, sinking gently into the
depths, blend their livid tints into a strange, mysterious gloom, through which one can still see the white gleam of the rushing river and
hear the distant murmur of its flow. Now is the time to see the full majesty of the cañon. Perched on an outstanding crag, one can look
down the ravine and mark headland behind headland mounting out of the gathering shadows and catching upon their scarred fronts of red
and yellow the mellower tints of the sinking sun. And above all lie the dark folds of pine sweeping along the crests of the precipices,
which they crown with a rim of green. There are gorges of far more imposing magnitude in the Colorado Basin, but for dimensions large
enough to be profoundly striking, yet not too vast to be taken in by the eye at once, for infinite changes of picturesque detail, and for
brilliancy and endless variety of coloring, there are probably few scenes in the world more impressive than the Grand Cañon of the
Yellowstone.” Along the twenty miles of cañon where the walls are highest they have been carved by glacial agencies and weather-worn
into many curious forms, generally columnar, but sometimes presenting the appearance of spires, domes, turrets and crenelated
battlements, and everywhere the matchless colors of yellow, red, green, and many tints are present. After passing down the extreme
length of the cañon, we took the less
traveled road running east from
Yancy’s Camp and visited the petrified
forests; and here we began to comprehend
more thoroughly than before the
mysteries of the Yellowstone Park
Basin. The evidence is here abundant
that in the remote past this entire region
of 375 square miles was a pleasant vale,
where a luxuriant forest abounded, and
many monster animals, long since extinct,
found a pleasant abode. Following
this period of delightful natural
conditions, there succeeded a flood of
ice that came sweeping with almost
unimaginable force from the north,
grinding, tearing and destroying until
the region was denuded and the very
earth furrowed and torn into the wonderful
disfigurements which we now
behold. In this terrific flood the
mountains were precipitated and
folded upon the forests and buried
with the monster animals that had
sought refuge in the spots which
became their cemeteries. In the rents thus made the grinding ice flowed until it reached the internal furnace of the world, which generating
gases and steam, explosions followed that tore wider the earth’s womb and made the region a fiery cave. Into the devious caverns thus formed
water from underground rivers continues to flow, over subterranean fires that convert it into steam, and thus at the many vents we observe
the ever active, though constantly waning, energies of the volcano.</p>

<p class='c011'>But there have been two glacial drifts over a great part of North America, and the second ice-flood scoured the earth in such manner
as to frequently uncover the forests and animal remains that were buried by the first great deluge. It is in the region of the Petrified and
Fossil Forests that we note the evidence of the truth of this theory; not only in Yellowstone Park, but in the Bad Lands of Dakota, the
dry lake basins of the Southwest and, in fact, in nearly every State of the Union. But in Yellowstone Park the remains of petrified trees
are particularly numerous, and it is here that we observe the most beautiful specimens of chalcedony lying about in promiscuous profusion,
like the ruins of some magnificent palace. Every tree here, overwhelmed by the ice-flood, became, in a thousand years thereafter, a pillar
of the most exquisite beauty, and we now examine them with wondering curiosity, then convert them into articles of use and adornment.</p>

<p class='c011'>The same chemical action which changed the forests of this region into gem-like stone, also preserved the bones of many huge
creatures which met their death suddenly
in this volcanic basin. Here and
there specimen relics of gigantic animals
may be found in the fossil district
east of Yellowstone River, though they
are becoming scarce because of the
immense quantity that has been carried
away by scientific bone collectors and
the admirers of curious things during
the several years that the park has been
a popular resort.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this same district there is a depression
or basin, about three hundred
yards in diameter, which has received
the title of Death Valley, a designation
that is appropriately applied because it
is not only an ossuary, where the bones
of many animals lie about in promiscuous
profusion, but such noxious gases
emanate from the basin that it is represented
as a place where no creature can
survive the exhalations for more than
a few minutes.</p>

have also, to a certain extent, the virtue to preserve, the bodies of creatures thus destroyed exhibiting slight evidences of decay for a month
or more after death. On account of the danger attending a critical investigation of this noxious plague-spot, those who have visited the
place have been compelled to exercise great caution, and to use field-glasses in making their examinations. One rash person is known to
have attempted a passage of the basin, but he was unable to advance more than twenty yards, and had he not retained the presence of mind
to hold his breath, when he found himself affected by the gas, escape from certain death would hardly have been possible. No scientific
investigator has ever visited the spot, so far as I have been able to learn, and reports of the deadly exhalations which characterize it
therefore come from the few persons who have approached the place out of curiosity. It is also, and fortunately, no doubt, very difficult to
reach, that portion of the Park being
almost inaccessible by reason of the
rugged topography, the jagged stones
and almost impassable crevices which
surround it. No roads have been
surveyed in the locality, and only the
intrepid, venturous and agile can reach
the malignant basin, at the expense of
great effort and endurance; for it is
easier to climb the Tetons than to surmount
the grim barriers which guard
Death Valley. Assuming that the
reports made by several persons who
claim to have visited the spot are true,
and which there is not lacking reason
to believe, an explanation of its deadly
character is not difficult to give, because
similar conditions, though in
much lesser degree, are found in many
localities within the Park.</p>

<p>HARVEST SCENE ON DALRYMPLE’S FARM, NORTH DAKOTA.—<span class="multicaption">During the prosperous era of wheat-raising, this was one of the most celebrated farms in the world. It covered an area of 50,000 acres, and both steam and horse-power were employed, not only in plowing the soil, but in harvesting and threshing the grain as well.

<p>LONE STAR GEYSER CONE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The geysers, such as are now
active, are confined within a district
whose radius does not exceed twenty-five
miles, but there are unquestionable
evidences that they were distributed
over a much greater area before the
last glacial epoch. Indeed, appearances
indicate that at one time, in the
very remote past, the whole present
extent of the Park was occupied by
either a sea of fire or a tremendous
cluster of volcanoes. When the glacial
catastrophe occurred the mountains
on the north, whence the ice-flood
descended, were pushed forward and
deposited in the fiery basin. By this
action the formerly mountainous lands to the north were leveled and became vast plains, as we now find them. The caldron of fiery activity
was filled up by the material thus deposited, but confinement of the gases, which were being constantly generated, caused repeated explosions,
the results of which we find in the cañons that ramify the district. It will not fail to escape the notice of the geologist that of the many
rivers and streams that penetrate the Park, not one of them flows from the north, though immediately south of the Park the Snake River
takes its rise, and has cut a way through the Teton Range that must have once opposed its passage. These mountains, as well as other
ranges in the vicinity, are a part of the residue carried down by the glacial flood, and thus changed the slope, which was formerly towards
the south, to a contrary direction.
Several new basins were created by
this enormous deposition, for it was
impossible, by reason of the eruptions
caused by escaping gases, that
the deposit should show equal distribution.
One of these basins is
Death Valley, which, originally a
geyser or volcano, was suppressed
by the glacial deposit, though the
furnace which fed it was not extinguished.
The condition is therefore
like that of a charcoal kiln,
which, burning beneath a covering
of earth, still allows the smoke and
gases to escape. But since the
geysers are not produced by the
consumption of combustible material,
but by chemical decomposition,
though the action of fire and
water, no smoke is created and thus
none is seen escaping from the
valley; but the deadly gases, all the
more poisonous because of their
temporary confinement, are constantly
exuding through the earth-covering,
having no connection
with any active geyser through
whose vent they might escape.</p>

<p>A HARVEST FIELD IN DAKOTA.—<span class="multicaption">Such a harvest scene as this can be seen nowhere else in the world except upon the broad and rich prairies of the Northwest, and in a few localities in California. Eight self-binding reapers are at work in the field so accurately photographed before us, requiring an army of workmen in the proper handling of the golden grain. In California, where the climate is dry and the rain falls only at certain seasons, the harvesting is done with heading machines, and the grain is cut, threshed and sacked all at the same time. But more care is required in the Dakotas, where the rainfall is more frequent and uncertain.</span></p>

wonderland. There is a grim connection between the fossil district
in which the bones of so many extinct animals have been found so
plentifully, and Death Valley, in which the remains of existent
creatures attest the continued destructive result of the ice-flood.
Truly, the ways of Providence are ways of mystery; and the more

<p>KEPLER’S CASCADE, FIRE-HOLE RIVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>After making an examination of the petrified and fossil forests,
we retraced our way and returned to Mammoth
Hot Springs Hotel by the road that
leads to Clark’s Fork Mines, a route which
I cannot recommend to dyspeptics, for it is
worse than a jolting stool. A few hours’
stop at the hotel to arrange our baggage,
and we resumed our journey eastward over
the Northern Pacific, which thereafter runs
through the apparently boundless plains of
North Dakota. The road follows the Yellowstone
from Livingstone to Glendine, a
distance of 175 miles, but there is little diversity
in the landscape on the immediate
line. Big Horn River intersects the road at
Custer City, below which town, twenty miles,
on the river, is Fort Custer; and the tragic
field upon which Custer and his entire command
were slaughtered by the Sioux Indians
is only twenty-five miles southeast of the
fort. Everything hereabout appears to be
a rueful reminder of that terrible 15th of
July, 1876, for the name of Custer greets us
everywhere we turn until we get beyond
Miles City. Between this latter point and
the Missouri River are the Bad Lands,
extending over a large tract of country that
includes both Montana and Dakota, but the
formations, while curious, are not nearly so
wonderful as those in Wyoming, described
in an earlier chapter. Although the
mounds, monuments and pillars of earth are
less lofty, the district acquires a particular
interest from the fact that interspersed among
the earthen columns are the erect bodies of
petrified trees, scarcely distinguishable, at a
little distance, however, from the fantastically
eroded monoliths that are disposed like
skirmishers over the otherwise level plain.
These so-called Bad Lands, which reappear
also in South Dakota, are not what the term
would seem to signify for the land is not lacking in fertility, being frequently rich with loam, though more often extremely sandy or covered
with soft sandstones that have been worn until they are round as cannon-balls. Indeed, Cannon-Ball River, which flows into the Missouri
sixty miles south of Bismark,
takes its name from the numerous
round sandstones that
are scattered along its banks.
Five miles below is Standing
Rock Agency of the Sioux,
so called from a sandstone
which stands some three feet
tall, and by the Sioux is believed
to be a petrified squaw.
Thus for a considerable distance
north and south, as well
as east and west, peculiar formations
characteristic of the
Bad Lands are met with, furnishing
proof that this area
was once a forest, later a great
salt sea, and then a plain,
each representing a long
period of time.</p>

The stream is so narrow, however, that two boats were unable to pass each other except at particular points where the banks were cut out for that purpose. It was like a single track line of street railway with turnouts. The ferry scene indicates the river’s width at Fargo, which was the southern terminus of navigation.</span></p>

Soon after reaching St. Paul our party divided, two of our photographers being instructed to take views of the falls, lakes and river-scenery
thereabouts, while the other set out with the camera car, over the Chicago, St. Paul and Omaha Railroad, to Sioux City,
and thence by the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad to Deadwood. There is nothing of particular interest to
entertain the traveler in search of scenic wonders until Iowa is crossed and we reach the Big Sioux River; nor is the immediate
district about Sioux City one affording scenery of much importance. But at Dell Rapids, something more than one hundred miles
north, we come in contact with some surprises which are without example, save in the Wisconsin River, hereafter to be described.
The town derives its name from the remarkable freaks of nature displayed along the river-banks, and known as the Dells, and which are
recognized as the safety-valves of the immense
water-power at Dell Rapids. This picturesque
stretch of fantastic bluffs and eccentric stream
is thus described by a writer who recently
made the passage in a canoe from Dell Rapids
to Sioux Falls.</p>

<p>DANGER ROCK, DELLS OF THE SIOUX.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Beginning at a break in the Big Sioux
River, on the south bank, opposite the town,
at first the Dells present the appearance of a
rivulet flowing out of the main body of water,
taking a circuitous direction to re-unite with
the parent stream some two and one-half
miles further along its eccentric course. Yet
only in the highest stages of its waters does
the Sioux overflow the dam across the aperture
between itself and the Dells, and it becomes
instantly apparent that it is not from the river
that this peculiar branch, which is not a
branch, obtains its water supply. Investigation
determines that the Dells are fed by
invisible springs, indefinite in number and
indefinable in volume, which maintain in
the bed of this curious stream an average
depth of about eleven feet, although a much
greater depth is found in various places. As
you progress along the banks of the Dells, you notice increasing accumulations of the well-known Big Sioux quartzite, in its dull red and
leaden colors; the banks grow more and more precipitous; the rocks are heaped strata upon strata in immeasurable quantities, and take on
fantastic shapes and unusual formations; the Dells deepen into a gorge, far down into the bottom of which the waters taking their hues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>from the sky above them, creep along in almost imperceptible ripples. Overhead, pile on pile, hangs the rugged quartzite, shelving out
over the liquid blue beneath; in the sides of the rocky banks innumerable swallows build their nests, while above them shrubbery clings
and cacti grow, seemingly nurtured in a soil of adamant. Perhaps the highest perpendicular point, from the summits of the overhanging
rocks to the waters below, is very nearly forty-five feet; but so precipitous is the descent, and so grotesquely wild the aspect, that it is no
wonder the majority of tourists report the height much greater. Descending a fissure, gazing down which descent seemed impossible, the
writer pushed off in a rude canoe and paddled for some distance under the overshadowing banks. Here, indeed, looking upward, the
impression was intensified, for upheavals had torn these banks apart and given to them, with whimsical violence, their strangely weird
formations.” Beyond Sioux City the country is monotonously level until, far in Nebraska, the road rushes into Elkhorn Cañon and passes
for a considerable distance between walls
sometimes vertical, but never very high, and
which lack the grandeur and coloring that
characterize those of mountain streams.
Emerging from Elkhorn Cañon, the road runs
for a long distance through the Niobrara
Valley, though never close to that stream,
until it crosses the river at Valentine. The
southern line of South Dakota lies only a few
miles north, and from Valentine west the
road approaches to within twenty-five miles
of the Rose-Bud and Pine Ridge Reservations,
and of Wounded Knee, the scene of the last
Indian insurrection, and of Pine Ridge
Agency, where Sitting Bull was killed.
Crossing White River at Dakota Junction, the
road turns due north, and passing out of the
plains of Nebraska enters the mountainous
country known as the Black Hills, at Buffalo
Gap. On the east are the <i>Mauvais Terres</i>,
or Bad Lands of South Dakota, which extend
west to the South Fork of Cheyenne River,
while towards the west is the rugous, rough
and riotous district known as the Black Hills.
At Buffalo Gap connection is made with
a narrow-gauge spur of the main line of road, which runs southwesterly a distance of fifteen miles and terminates at the Minnekahta, or
Hot Springs. In making this run we pass through a mighty gorge whose age-swept and vertical walls climb up, stratum upon stratum, to
a height of several hundred feet, and then break into spear-pointed peaks, called the “Needles.” This is Fall River Cañon, noted for its
spires, parti-colored walls, and beautiful waterfalls that leap from a hundred brinks into the arms of the rushing river. That this is a land
of gold is not better proved by the fact that the Black Hills were purchased of the Sioux by the Government in 1876, at the enormous price
of $70,000,000 and support of the Indians for seven generations, than that the output of the several gold and silver mines of the district
exceeds $100,000,000; verily, a richer land than Ophir.</p>

<p class='c011'>Turning back, we resumed our journey northward over the Elkhorn road, and passed through many miles of the most magnificent
scenery to be found anywhere on the American Continent. The entire region is mountain infested, and to penetrate it by rail the road is
compelled to follow the almost interminable sinuosities of creeks and broken valleys, with tunnels every few miles, and bridges quite as
frequent. Through Fan-Tail Gulch the road winds in tortuous ways that sometimes draw grotesque figures, and in one place the road-bed
is of the exact shape of a horseshoe, while on both sides of Elk Creek Cañon there are butting and pinnacled walls that suggest ruins of
gigantic cathedrals, or monuments
in a graveyard of Titans.
Everywhere we turn there is
the carving and hieroglyphic
writing of the glacier and the
volcano that in some age
wrestled with the rocks and left
them in a confusion of whimsical
forms. Particularly is this
true of Elk Creek Cañon, which
presents many curious bluffs
and isolated shafts of stone,
worn into monoliths of oddity

<p class='c011'>After passing Piedmont the
region is less rugged and gradually
falls away into a plain,
dotted here and there with
buttes of clay, some of them
reaching a height of fifty feet,
and in the distance resembling
large buildings. Fort Meade
and Bear Butte are on the right
as we make a turn towards the
west, then run south, until we
enter Deadwood, which lies at
the gnarled and bunioned feet
of the Hills. We have scarcely
been out of a cañon since leaving
Hot Springs, but at Deadwood
the granite walls that have become so familiar slope away until they become hills of slate and red clay, which have been denuded of
their vestures of pine to supply fuel for the reduction mills. Through one of the last rifts in the walls that confine the track of the railroad
a glimpse of Central City is obtained, several miles away, and a few minutes later we roll into the great mining town that is celebrated for
its wealth, energy, golden prospects, and as being the place where Wild Bill was killed, and Calamity Jane broke the biggest faro bank in
the settlement. Though Deadwood is only sixteen years old, few cities have passed through so many terrible vicissitudes. In 1876 the
gold prospectors in the Hills were harried
by Indians; then when the district was
purchased and active settlement began,
gamblers and shady women flocked to the
place, considering that every honest person
was legitimate prey, until the vigilantes
restored order. Building was rapid,
so that three years after the miners staked
their first claims in the Hills, Deadwood
had become a place of 5,000 inhabitants
and was rapidly flowering into a great
city. Then a dreadful fire broke out,
which ravaged and swept the town, leaving
scarcely a house uninjured, and
nearly every citizen homeless. The loss
was estimated at $1,500,000, but in its
effects the loss was probably twice that
amount. But with that courageous energy
which characterizes western settlements,
the people went to work to rebuild before
even the embers had turned to ashes, and
by 1883, Deadwood was a second time
showing a metropolitan bud. She had
emerged from the crucible, but fate had
resolved that she should be subjected to
another ordeal. Accordingly, the elements
gathered their forces all around upon the
mountains and in the gulches. For weeks
unprecedented snow-storms bombarded
the country and covered it to an extraordinary
depth. Then the windows of heaven
were opened and the rain descended. Day
and night a terrific down-pour continued,
followed directly by a flood that struck
the town from every direction, and with
irresistible might washed nearly every
building from its foundation, leaving even
small opportunity for the unhappy people
to escape to the hills. But though the
town was twice destroyed, the citizens
lost none of their pluck, and before the cruel waters were fully assuaged they resumed the work of building again on the same twice stricken
site, and have so continued until Deadwood is fortified against calamity and is moving on at the head of the procession, with colors flying
and drums beating, the capital city of a capital country.</p>

Harney, who won fame and glory in the battles of his country with Mexico and the red warriors of the West. It was principally through his firmness, bravery and wisdom, aided by the confidence which the Indians reposed in his integrity, that the hidden treasures and scenic wonders of the Black Hills were delivered up to the white people. It is said that the Indians who formerly occupied this region frequently exchanged gold nuggets and gold bullets for leaden ones of the same weight, so abundant was the yellow metal in some portions of their country—a statement, however, which lacks confirmation.</span></p>

<p>VIEW OF BEAR BUTTE, AT A DISTANCE OF FORTY-SIX MILES FROM THE ROAD, IN FAN-TAIL GULCH.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There are many interesting points within a few miles of Deadwood; for aside from the rugged character of the scenery, in the near vicinity
are several of the largest wealth-producing
mines in the world.
The trip to Bald Mountain over
the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri
Valley narrow-gauge Road
is one filled with pleasure and
surprise. The way is almost
incomparably winding, and exhibits
remarkable examples of
engineering skill and enormous
investment. In several places
the grade is four hundred and
thirty feet to the mile, while
the curves are said to be of one
hundred and fifty feet radius.
Passing up such grades and
around such sharp turns, it is not
so surprising that the train should
in one minute be running along
lofty benches, apparently in
mid-air, over dizzy trestles, and
in the next few moments be
scurrying through a valley so
deep that sunlight rarely ever
visits it. North of Bald Mountain,
and reached by a stage-line,
are Crow Peak, Round-Top
Mountain, and the town of
Spearfish. This latter place is
located on a creek of the same
name that goes tumbling
through a deep cañon with vertical,
serrated walls, and diversified
by roaring cascades and far-leaping waterfalls. Returning to Deadwood, we took the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad south
through another long stretch of turbulent scenery, of rushing creeks, darksome gorges, under the shadows of lofty mountains, and by curious
formations. Custer Peak is only two or three miles east of the road, and it is the center of a riotous region of broken stone, each one a very
mountain of itself. Below, we strike Spring Creek, and go bowling along the valley cut out of the bills by that stream, until Harney’s Peak
breaks into view, five miles to the east, and lifts its piney crest into the azure depths 8,000 feet. Hereabout are not only waterfalls,
cañons, creeks, and huge bowlders dashed down from frost-riven peaks, for besides gold and silver, the region is said to abound with tin,
that peculiarly elusive mineral
which, though often found,
seems to always dematerialize
after the campaign is over; and
though millions have been spent
in developing the tin mines
near Harney, the product has
not yet paid the expense of
mining. Three miles south of
the peak are the Needles, bold-jutting
pinnacles of sandstone
that stand high above the bed
of Squaw Creek and point their
fingers toward the sky. Buckhorn
Mountain stands very
near the west side of the road,
and close to its base reposes the
town of Custer, the center of a
broken district called Custer
Park, famous for its scenery of
river, tumultuary and distorted
rocks over which a weasel can
hardly make its way. A little
further south we enter Red
Cañon Creek, where the same
general character of eroded and
disrupted rocks continues, with
occasional exhibitions of oddity
exceeding those previously seen
in the Hills. Evidently some
terrific force has been at work
in this uncanny region, for here
and there our wonder is excited
by extraordinary instances of
displacement. Beecher Rocks
are comicalities done in stone,
but Wedge Rock must wear the
garland as the most astounding
example of natural tumult in
this wonder-region, and which
can be better understood by the
accompanying illustration, than
explained by the bare use of
words.</p>

<p>WEDGE ROCK, NEAR CUSTER CITY.—<span class="multicaption">This immense rock, weighing thousands of tons, found a lodgment, where it is photographed, after a terrific plunging descent from near the top of the mountain, whence it was riven by some mighty convulsion. The path of its terrible fall is still discernible, in seams and abrasions on the face of the mountain, and in contemplating it one cannot refrain from regretting that he was not present to witness such an awe-inspiring and dreadful exhibition.

<p>THE HORSESHOE IN ELK CREEK CAÑON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>But the country is not only
rugged and mountain-spurred;
it possesses curiosities even
greater beneath the surface than
those which diversify the sun-kissed
landscape over which
we have just passed. On Elk
Creek, and entered from the
cañon wall, is Keith’s Crystal
Cave, a colossal rent in the
mountain bowels, with passages
fifteen miles in length. It is
beautifully chambered, from
which depend the most exquisite
crystallizations in the form of
stalactites and stalagmites that
reflect the torchlight in glorious
colors, dancing from column of
onyx to pools of pellucid water.</p>

<p class='c011'>But a more remarkable cave
than Keith’s is found a little
way west of Custer, and twelve
miles north of Hot Springs.
This marvelous natural excavation
is ramified by many passages
which have been explored
for a distance of sixty-five miles,
and the end is not yet. On
account of the peculiar respiration
of the cave, the air at one
time rushing in with great velocity
and again being expelled
with equal force, it is called
the Wind Cave; and no better name can be bestowed, for the cause of this inrushing and regurgitation of air seems to be beyond ascertainment.
Like its more northerly cousin, Wind Cave is chambered and adorned with beautiful crystals that shimmer under the glances of
the torch and are set aflame with color, with here and there such graceful formations as to suggest studios of monster sculptors.</p>

<p>THE DEVIL’S CHAIR, ST. CROIX RIVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>We had to travel about
twenty-five miles across a fairly
level stretch of country before
reaching the Belle Fourche
River, a main branch of the
Cheyenne, on the west bank of
which is located this marvelous
monument of the ages, which
for its astounding size and unaccountable
formation is called
the Devil’s Tower. Among the
Sioux Indians, who have always
regarded it with superstitious
dread, it is known as the Mateo’s Tepee, signifying the Bear’s Lodge, and was by them supposed to be the haunt of a were-animal, who
possessed the power of becoming a bear or man at pleasure. The country within a radius of fifty miles is slightly broken by high table-lands,
but there is nothing to indicate
any special spasm of nature by
which so great a freak might
have been formed; yet out of
this undulating expanse of landscape
suddenly rises a stupendous
obelisk of vitrified stone, to
the amazing height of eight
hundred feet. The base, which
measures 326 feet at its longest
diameter, is 400 feet above the
river-bed, which in turn is 500
feet above sea level. Thus measured,
the peak of this amazing
tower is 1,700 feet above the
sea; no surprise therefore that
it is visible for a distance of
forty miles. But the wonder
which such a colossal shaft
naturally excites is immensely
increased by the fact that the
Devil’s Tower is a composition
of huge crystals of basalt, or
volcanic rock, which lie in columns
some three feet in diameter,
and continue unbroken from
the base to the peak, giving to
it a fibrous appearance. The
walls are almost vertical, with
a slightly vertical slope, to give
it a more graceful contour, and
though there are occasional rifts
in the sides, no human being,
however skilful as a spire-climber,
can ever accomplish
its ascent.</p>

<p>TEA-TABLE ROCK, WISCONSIN RIVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The enquiry is irresistible: “What wondrous force created this petrified monster of the Wyoming table-lands?” One plausible
answer may be built upon the theory that here, at one time, was the bed of an ocean, a supposition supported by such evidences as the
finding of sea-shells and bones of extinct sea-creatures all about over the ground, and deeply embedded in the earth throughout the section.
When the waters receded, this inequality, which might have existed as an island, was left as the product of volcanic action. But a yet more
reasonable cause may be found in the supposition that along the Belle Fourche was the center of intense volcanic energy sometime during
the very remote past, during which period the spot occupied by the tower was a volcano-vent out of which poured lava in such a slow and
steady flow that it deposited in basaltic columnar crystals at the apex. Thus gradually it grew in size and height, like many of the
formations in Yellowstone Park, until the volcano had expended its force and left this vast monument as an everlasting evidence of its
persistence through centuries of activity. But however it was formed, the Devil’s Tower takes a place in the first list of the world’s
greatest natural wonders, and it deserves to be
much better known than it is.</p>

<p class='c011'>Returning from a long and very wearying
ride to the Tower, we again took the Burlington
Road, retracing much of the way we had
come, and proceeded to Crawford, Nebraska,
in order to view two famous curiosities known
as Crow Butte and Signal Rock, which are
near that town. Fort Robinson post and military
reservation are a mile west, on White
River, and the country is picturesque with
buttes, which rise out of the prairie lands in
singular impertinence and unseemliness, while
considerable bluffs confine the river. The territory
was for many years the scene of bitter
strifes between the Sioux and Crow Indians,
who reddened nearly every acre of the ground
with their blood, and left remembrances of their
occupancy and incidents of their adventures
in names which they gave to a hundred points
in the near vicinity of Crawford. South of the
town, about five miles, a conspicuous object in
a wide range is Crow Butte, a titanic elevation
of stone, nearly two hundred feet in height
and several hundred yards in circumference,
with vertical walls on all sides except one, in
which there is a winding-way by which a horseman may ride to the top. The legend is told that on one occasion a party of Crow Indians
were so savagely pursued by their old enemies that they took refuge on the top of Crow Butte, where, though much fewer in number, they
so valorously defended the narrow roadway that the Sioux were driven back each time they attempted to gain the summit. Being unable
to dislodge them, the Sioux resolved to besiege the Crows until starvation compelled them to surrender. For several days and nights the
siege continued, until at length hunger drove the Crows to a desperate expedient. Watching their time, when the night was darkest, they
killed some of their ponies, and converting their hides into lariats, lowered one after another of their number to the ground below on the
opposite side of the butte, until all but one old Indian had been safely delivered, who was left a while to keep the camp-fire burning. On
the following day the old man came down
and surrendered himself to the Sioux, and
related to them the wonderful means by which
his comrades had escaped. Instead of killing
him, as might have been expected, on this
one occasion the Sioux magnanimously gave
him his liberty as a recompense for the loyalty
and bravery which he had exhibited.</p>

<p class='c011'>The twin cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis
represent the intrusion of civilization
upon the primeval lands of romance, and thus
while we admire the imposing wealth and
architectural beauties of these great metropoli,
we cannot avoid a feeling of semi-regret that
they have grown at the expense and sacrifice
of some of the most charming natural wonders
that first attracted public interest to the vast
Northwest. The head of navigation on the
Mississippi is unalterably fixed at St. Paul,
for above that point the river is a brawling
stream, flowing over ledges and rushing
through contracted passages lined with bluffs.
At Minneapolis are the Falls of St. Anthony,
but no longer do these present the furious
aspect which once characterized them, for
the wild riot of turbulent waters that formerly
went dashing over a high brink with a roar
that made the shore to tremble, have been
harnessed, and are now driven over sloping
tables so as to glide softly into the bed below.
The channel, too, has been cut and buttressed
with masonry, so that the strong right arm
of the falls is made a servant of commerce in
supplying the motive-power for many immense
flouring mills.</p>

St. Anthony’s Falls, and seeking the wonders

a silver stream, slaking the thirst of the linnet

of the sunshine it spreads itself over a ledge
like a veil of gossamer and drops into the
cool shades that welcome its embraces. The
Falls of Minnehaha are an example of that

sizes, like Minnetonka and Great Bear, to
which thousands resort when sultry winds
blow and the blazing sun of summer-time
drives sweltering humanity to such cool
retreats. But the beauties of this northern
region are not exhausted by lake and waterfall,
which though charming, cannot compete
for interest with some of the natural marvels
that exist in the neighbor State of Wisconsin.</p>

<p class='c011'>Minnehaha is one of the smallest of the many beautiful and celebrated waterfalls of America, but it is also the most lovely and poetic. It is like a drapery of lace-work

<p>SIGNAL ROCK, NEAR CAMP DOUGLAS, WISCONSIN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The bluffs of sandstone are a source of
unending surprise, rising out of the water so
nearly perpendicular that they defy all effort
to scale them, and present a front like the
walled cities of ancient times. Nature has not left them
undisturbed, either, for their toussled brinks and seared sides
show the finger-marks of frost in deep fissures and eccentric
cleavages, while here and there fantastic images of stone
stand like grim sentinels on commanding ledges, keeping
unwearied watch upon the industrious river. Most curious
of these erratic formations is the Devil’s Chair, which the
Chippewa Indians verily believe was one time the resting-place
of his sable majesty, probably when he went fishing.
Anyhow, the rock bears the autographs of many adventurous
persons who have been there to see. The fishing certainly
was very good in this spot before Wisconsin lumbermen
filled the stream so full of pine-logs that not even the devil
himself could keep his line from fouling.</p>

<p class='c011'>East of the St. Croix is Chippewa River, flowing in the
same general direction, but aside from being a pretty stream
it has nothing to specially interest tourists, for the banks
gently shelve, and where stone appears it is in thin layers,
and the shore-line never rises to the dignity of bluffs. But
the Chippewa Indians, though now small in numbers, still
retain their ancient homes in the vicinity of the stream,
which, because of its shallowness, is not used as extensively
as the St. Croix for shooting logs to the Mississippi. Though
surrounded by a vigorous civilization, these Indians, if we
except their clothing, exhibit little change from their original
customs and manners of living, subsisting by hunting,
fishing, and gathering berries for the neighboring markets.
They still make birch-bark canoes, like their forefathers, and
in a way, too, that white men do not appear to be able to
imitate. Specimens of their deft work are on sale in all the
towns of Wisconsin, from which source they derive no
little profit.</p>

Not many visitors go there in winter-time, for the north wind is biting cold; but those who do go are rewarded with a vision of loveliness unsurpassed in the realms of romance or fact. Beneath the winter sun it becomes a fairy palace, turreted with columns of alabaster, studded with diamonds and pearls, that sparkle and glow with the iridescent hues of the rainbow.</span></p>

<p>CLEOPATRA’S NEEDLE, DEVIL’S LAKE.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the eastern part of the State, in Howano county, lives
a small tribe called the Menomines, who are in what may be
called the transition period, for their manner of living is a
composite of modern ways and ancient usage and belief.
Some of the Menomines appear to be thoroughly civilized, at
least so far as outward indications show, while the patriarchs
of the tribe remain steadfast in the faith of their fathers.
They have lost none of their confidence in the Medicine Man,
whose counsel in political affairs is as important

<p class='c011'>A Medicine Man being questioned as to
how the power which he claimed was conferred,
answered thus:</p>

<p class='c011'>“My heart told me that I should be a
Medicine Man, and I went out upon a mountain
and fasted and prayed for two days, awaiting
a sign from the Great Spirit. At the end of
the second day, as the sun was going to
sleep, I saw a great light which blinded my
eyes, and heard a noise as of the rushing of
many waters. I looked around again, and
about me were four animals—a black-tailed
deer, a white-tailed deer, a wolf and a buffalo.
They all spoke the speech of men. They
said that the Great Spirit had heard my
prayer and had sent them to me. The animals
then took me over the prairies and told
me what plants were hurtful and what were
good for my people. They told me what
diseases of men the good herb would cure,
and then they vanished as suddenly as they
came. I returned to my people, told the
chiefs what I had seen, was made and have
since been a Medicine Man.”</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>CLEFT ROCK, DEVIL’S LAKE, WISCONSIN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>But the transition from savage superstition
to civilized modes is apparent among the
Menomines, not only in the adoption of modern
clothing, houses, household utensils and
Christian ideas; it appears also in the change
of their superstitions. They still believe in
Medicine Men, and indulge in what is known
as the Medicine Dance, but only at the time
of the initiation of new candidates for such
honors; and their doctors must now be the
possessors of more or less medical knowledge,
and be able to read and write. The ceremony
is too long and tedious to describe, but the
most superficial observer cannot fail to detect
through it all the influence of contact with
civilization.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Ojibways are another remnant of the
great Indian tribes of the Northwest, whose
homes are in Polk county, in the vicinity of
Balsam Lake, a pretty sheet of water in a
wild district, where fishing is good and game
still fairly abundant. One peculiarity of these Indians is the sacredness with which they regard their dead, and the care they take to
preserve the bodies of relatives from violation. They are content to house themselves, even through the severest winters, in the flimsiest
structures, which afford very little shelter from the cold, but their dead they carefully wrap in blankets and deposit them in small oblong
houses that are made to perfectly exclude rain, snow and cold, except such as may enter by a square little door in one end. These miniature
mortuary houses are placed close to the homes of the living, that a better watch may be kept upon them; but what superstitious motive
prompts this custom, I have not been able to learn.</p>

<p>THE SUGAR-BOWL, DELLS OF THE WISCONSIN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Wisconsin is very justly famous for many things: its semi-civilized Indian tribes, its lakes, dense pine forests, and above all for its
wondrous scenery, particularly
along the Wisconsin River,
where wonders the equal of
those to be seen in Watkins’
Glen, New York, are met with
in rapid succession some six
miles north and south of Kilbourn
City. It was to Kilbourn
City, therefore, that we proceeded,
by way of the Chicago,
Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad,
to view and photograph
the truly marvelous scenery
and whimsically erratic formations
that characterize that
section of the river known as
the Dells. The river is deep,
but at places so tortuously narrow
between projecting elbows
of the limestone walls that only
such a dimity and fairy-like
steamboat as the <i>Dell Queen</i>
can thread a passage, and we
accordingly committed ourselves
to this frail little craft
for the trip which is made by
tourists first to the Upper Dells, eight miles above the city, and then to the Lower Dells, which are three miles below. For many, many
centuries the Wisconsin, probably always a rapid stream, has rasped its soft Potsdam sandstone-bed, and constantly wearing its shore, has
finally carved out a way that is fantastically curious. Now the stream rolls laughing along under vertical walls sometimes a hundred feet
high, and wrought into the most weirdly grotesque forms imaginable. All along, its capricious course is marked by caves, caverns, grottos,
glens, and eccentric pillars of stone that are as humorously dressed as a zany in caps and bells. In making the ascent from Kilbourn City
one of the first objects to arrest attention is “Angel Rock,” whose broad stretch of petrified wing is said to guard against intrusion into the
spectral haunts that lie beyond. “Swallow’s Fortress” next appears, a perpendicular wall of very great height, and unbroken length of
two hundred feet, garrisoned by myriads of swallows that have perforated the face until it looks like the lid of a huge pepper-box. Having
passed this castle of many loop-holes, we enter a section where “Romance Cliffs” pays eternal greetings to “High Rock,” with their
strange configurations and picturesque statuary; a spot that is favored by speckled trout as it is by lovers. “Chimney Rock” next bursts
into view, built up of as many strata as a tower of pan-cakes, which from a distance the chimney somewhat resembles. From the “Gate’s
Ravine” there is a splendid sight of “Sturgeon Rock,” which is so perfectly reflected as to appear twice its natural size. Why it is called
Sturgeon Rock not even tradition tells us; but it is manifest in many cases that those who bestowed names upon these pictorial surprises
were so arbitrary as to be indifferent to appropriateness, like the colored woman who called her first-born Beelzebub, because she heard that
some prince bore that name.</p>

<p>OCONOMONOC FALLS, WISCONSIN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>At a place where the river
broadens, and the left shore
spreads into a long level covered
with willows, while the right
bank continues its precipitous
career, there is a wide extension-table
projecting from the wall
which is called “Visor Ledge,
of Stand Rock.” This jutting
point is admirably designed for
a jumping-off place, and it is a
matter for surprise that it was
not christened Lover’s Leap,
like all other similar ledges and
shelves that I have seen. Beyond
this the river again
narrows, and singular efflorescences
of stone, like a garden
of flowering curios, wrap our
attention with questioning surprise.
“The Hawk’s Bill” is
certain to catch our notice, and
equally sure to excite our wonder
that it was not called the
“Toothless Old Man,” for it
does seem that he might make a
nut-cracker of his nose and chin. “Black Hawk’s Leap” must be accepted as a poor substitute for the “Lover’s Jump,” but as the latter
has no place on Wisconsin River the former name has been applied to a section of pictured wall that is excavated at the base, and in which
the gurgle of water is accentuated by echo into ominous noises. This natural excavation is called Black Hawk’s Cave, and is said to have
been the place of retreat of a vanquished party of Indians, who were murderously pursued by a large number of their enemies, but memory
fails to recall the particulars. A little further beyond is another grotto of still more remarkable formation, called “Cave of the Dark
Waters,” and rightly it is named, for the entrance is by a small portal into a commodious chamber whose first most noticeable characteristic
is its darkness. The water is deep throughout, and continually suggests the advantages of the cave as a place in which to commit crime,
or to kiss your girl while passing through a dark tunnel.</p>

Its resemblance to the ruins of some ancient fortification is so striking as to arouse the wonder and admiration of all beholders. The trees that have planted their roots in its sides and along the top of its mimic battlements serve to heighten the resemblance, so that one standing in its presence can hardly divest himself of the belief that he is really viewing the walls of some frowning relic of the warlike past.</span></p>

<p>CAVE OF THE DARK WATERS, LAKE SUPERIOR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is a positive relief from the oppression which entrance to the Dark Waters Cave produces to be hailed, after emerging, by a sturdy
little stone island with a tossing crest of pine, which some Sweet William has named the “Sugar-Bowl.” It is all the more refreshing
because islands in the river are exceedingly scarce, and this diversity of landscape is accordingly doubly appreciated.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still further beyond is the “Mouth of Witches’ Gulch,” commanded by picturesque cliffs that show the teeth-marks and lacerations
of the gnawing waters. So romantic is the spot, and so inviting the little saucer-shaped beach of white sand, that all the pleasure-boats
that ply in the Dells make a
landing here and give their passengers
opportunity to go on
shore and carve their names on
the terraced walls. So many
persons had been there before
us, however, that barely space
was found to write a pencil
autograph.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another stop is made at
“Cold Water Cañon,” usually
dry, but through which the river
pours in an impetuous torrent
during high water. Hereabout
are also glens and other curious
excavations, among which is a
hollow formation seventy feet
high and fifty broad, called the
“Devil’s Jug.” Another run
of less than a mile brings us to
“Steamboat Rock,” an oval
island covered with hemlock
and mountain cedars, opposite
to which a third landing is
made, and ascending three
flights of stairs to gain the summit
of the cliffs, across a stretch
of woods, and descending a steep, rocky ledge, we find ourselves at the superlative wonder of the Dells—Witches’ Gulch. Abruptly arriving
at the entrance of the gulch, above which 189 feet, in a projecting rock, may be seen the wry, unmistakable features of a tousled old hag,
the queen of the witches, so ominously frowning on forms and faces below. Without the slightest exaggeration it certainly is one of the
most wonderful, weird and peculiar places on this continent.</p>

<p class='c011'>Entering the gulch, we look up—far up—and catch glimpses of sunlight and see huge pines prostrate and lying from one ledge to
another, admonishing us to look well to our going. After many, many windings, we come into “Phantom Chamber,” and in the side of a
rocky ledge, scooped out, as if by hand, find
a natural basin, and take a drink of the cool
spring water gurgling out of the great rock
into this hidden Pool of Siloam. In this
rocky apartment we ascend a pair of stairs,
from under which the stream that meanders
through the entire gulch leaps in majestic
fall, its roar almost deafening, and spray
dashing over us. For thousands of years this
little stream—at first, probably, a switch of
rainfall on the earth’s surface—has been
engaged in wearing this chasm in the sandstone,
until now the gorge is seventy-five feet
deep, nearly a mile long, and in some places
so narrow that a large person can only pass
through with difficulty, especially at Fat Man’s

<p>FALLS OF ST. LOUIS RIVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Returning to Kilbourn City, on the
following day a trip was made to Taylor’s
Glen, which is thus well described by a correspondent:
“At the handsome school building
on the east side of the village, a rugged
path struggles down into an ordinary ‘hollow,’
which farther down and followed, opens
into a grand gorge. Every step now reveals
scenes and formations beside which all the
boasted charms of ‘Watkin’s Glen’ become
commonplace. Being neither cave nor valley,
but combining all the attractions of both, it
winds and twists through immense rocks in a
serpentine path. At one point, far overhead,
a sheet of daylight slants through a mere rift
the rocks. The roof and high-arching
walls are frescoed with diamond dew and dripping, drooping mosses and lichens. Groups of strange figures, carved by cataracts, washed
by whirlpools ages on ages ago, ape Egyptian gods and mummies of the ancient Orient. Here a crystal spring bursts from a wall of solid
stone and goes dancing down over pebbles and ferns. On through an ever-varying pathway filled with kaleidoscope-like enchantment we
wandered with awe and admiration, our journey ending at a long, dark tunnel, which looks out, through a wide, cavernous window, upon
the river beyond. The Lower Dells, like their companions above the village, have rocky banks, covered with vegetation, and curiously
shaped formations no less interesting than the aggregation, a description of which I have but faintly accomplished. One cannot see this
truly remarkable, weird, romantic and beautiful section of our land and suppress admiration. Nor will a week suffice for a thorough
exploration of the caves, grottos,
rocks and ravines hereabouts.
Above Witches’ Gulch is a beautiful
view of the river, its bluffs and
many islands, a fairly comparable
Lake George view. A fine drive is
had north from Kilbourn to ‘Hornet’s
Nest,’ ‘Squaw’s Chamber,’
‘Luncheon Hall,’ ‘Stand Rock,’
‘Devil’s Lake,’ and many points of
interest farther up the river and in
the country in this and adjoining
counties.”</p>

<p>RAPIDS OF MONTREAL RIVER, NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR.—<span class="multicaption">These picturesque rapids are located in the midst of a wooded dell, hemmed in and secluded by surrounding hills from the busy haunts of men. In peace and quiet they laugh and frolic and sing their merry song of rippling waters and dashing fountains through the summer days, and when winter comes they put on a dress of foamy puffs of white that sparkles and glows like a bed of diamonds in the dull rays of the northern sun.</span></p>

<p>GIANT’S CASTLE, NEAR CAMP DOUGLAS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The whole region within a
radius of thirty or more miles of
Kilbourn City, particularly on the
west, is full of natural curiosities,
for the district was evidently at one
time, in the remote past, the bed of
a lake whose swirling waters carved
the soft sandstones into many
astounding forms, and then were
assuaged by some force which geologists
fail to explain, leaving these
rare monuments of their work
behind them. Devil’s Lake, nearby,
is the relic of that vast inland
sea, which no doubt was a part of the great lakes, on the shores of which are many images of wondrous shapes and size, with many of
which interesting legends are connected. Thus “Sacrifice Stone,” in “Wonder Notch,” is popularly believed to be the rock on which
an Indian maiden was immolated at an unknown time to propitiate the anger of the Great Spirit, while “Cleft Rock” represents the fury
of the devil who, while in a passion over some act of the tribe, rose out of the lake and hurled one of his fiery darts with such poor aim
that it did no other damage than split the largest stone on the shore.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cleopatra’s Needle is likewise reputed to be the transformed and geologic remains of a very ancient Indian chief who was punished
by the devil for the audacity of attempting to penetrate
the mysteries of the lake; while another broken
and distorted stone on the front of East Mountain is
connected with a similar and indistinct tradition respecting
the invidious curiosity of a squaw. But
though there is no lack of superstitious beliefs among
the few Indians of the district, who respect these
queer formations as the relics of their forefathers,
there is no more foundation for them than the mere
claim that “so it has been told,” for no one has ever
heard the particulars. It is a forgotten story.</p>

<p>SUGAR-LOAF, MACINAC ISLAND.—<span class="multicaption">Macinac Island is a delightful and picturesque summer resort, located in the Strait of Macinac, which connects Lakes Michigan and Huron. It is only about three miles long by two wide, and is rough and rocky. The natural scenery is charming. The geologist finds mysteries in the calcareous rocks dripping at unexpected angles; the antiquarian feasts his eyes on the Druidical circles of the ancient stones; the invalid sits on the cliff’s edge in the vivid sunshine, and breathes in the buoyant air with delight. The haunted birches abound, and on the crags grow the wild larches beckoning with their long fingers, the most human tree of all. There are many natural curiosities on the island, the most noted being Sugar-Loaf, so beautifully photographed on this page. It is conical in shape, and rises to a height of 134 feet.</span></p>

<p>CHIMNEY AND BEE ROCKS, CAMP DOUGLAS, WISCONSIN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Near the west center of Juneau county, fifteen
miles east of the Wisconsin River, is a cross-roads
railroad town called Camp Douglas, which is in the
midst of a region remarkable for natural curiosities,
rivaling those found in the Bad Lands in Wyoming.
It is a country of sandstone that exhibits the astonishing
results of centuries of water and wind erosions upon
what was manifestly once a vast bed of argillaceous clay,
that in the process of time was converted into soft stone
as the lake dried up. The receding waters gradually
wore deep ravines in the sandstone, thus giving birth
to rivulets which aided a more rapid change in the bed
until it became traversed by numerous streams that in
time completely drained the lake. Then the winds
began their work of eroding, helped by the sand which
they carried, and the result became finally, as we
behold it in the Bad Lands, and in Monument Park,
Colorado, a large number of towers, domes, pinnacles
and other architectural forms. To the more strikingly
curious shapes names have been given, as the “Old
Guard,” “Giant’s Castle,” “Castle Rock,” “Chimney
Rock,” “Signal Rock,” “Beleaguered Castle,” etc.,
as shown by the illustrations.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Kilbourn City we went to Milwaukee, and
thence by the Chicago and Northwestern, and the Minneapolis,
St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad to St.
Ignace, where we took boat for Mackinac Island, a very
noted resort in the Straits of Mackinaw. This island
is celebrated for its splendid scenery, some of which
we photographed, after which we proceeded
to Sault Ste. Marie, the seat of government
of Chippewa county, Michigan, and noted for
having one of the largest and finest ship
canals in the world, through which, surprising
as the statement appears, a larger daily
tonnage passes than the Suez Canal accommodates.
One of the sights that are apt to claim
the particular attention of visitors now are
the new grain-carrying vessels called Whale-backs,
which have within the last three years
become a feature of our lake commerce.</p>

<div class='multicaption'>

<p class='c011'>In order to fully realize and appreciate the splendor and marvelous beauty of the Pictured Rocks and the scenery adjacent
thereto, they must be seen in winter, when they are dressed in their frosty sheets of ice and snow and ornamented with a thousand

<p>SIGNAL ROCK, CAMP DOUGLAS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In order to observe the shores more
clearly, we took one of the Lake Superior
Transit Company’s steamers at Sault Ste.
Marie for Duluth, a route which gives opportunity
for taking photographs of the incomparable
pictured cliffs of Superior. But at
Marquette, where the steamer lands, a yacht
was engaged in which we were able to approach
much of the finest scenery that would otherwise
have escaped our attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>The range of cliffs to which the name
of Pictured Rocks has been given, may be
regarded as among the most striking and
beautiful features of the scenery of the Northwest,
and is well worthy the attention of the
artist and the observer of geological phenomena.
They may be described, in general
terms, as a series of sandstone bluffs extending
along the shore of Lake Superior for about
five miles, and derive their name from the
great diversity of colors they display. They
are worn into strange shapes by frost and
storm, and stained by a thousand dyes in
every possible variety of arrangement, far
beyond the power of words to describe, and
all this profusion is repeated mile after mile,
keeping up the interest by some new prospect
of sweeping curve, or abrupt angle, or
fantastic form. “The ‘Castle,’ the first of the more striking features of the rocks, bears at a distance a great resemblance to an ancient
castle, with walls, towers, and battlements. Further on, a mass of detached rock called the ‘Sail Rock’ comes into view, and so striking
is its resemblance to a sloop with the jib and mainsail spread, that a short distance out on the lake any one would suppose it a real boat
sailing near the beach. But the principal feature of the rocks is the magnificent cave known as the ‘Grand Portal.’ Let the reader
imagine himself in a room 400 feet long by 18 feet wide, and 150 to 200 feet high to the arched roof, bulk of yellow sandstone, seamed
with decay, and dripping with water. Shout, and the voice is multiplied a hundred-fold by echoes that reverberate several seconds, sharp,
metallic. Here the stratum of gravel rises about fifty feet, while at the castle it is nearly down to the water’s level. The waters are
undermining the foundations, and wearing holes everywhere
in the support of the walls and the roof. The
water in the cave increases in depth as you go out
towards the lake, from the bare rocks of the back
end to about fifty feet at the opening, and a few rods
from the shore it is a hundred feet, or more. The cliff
on the west, next to the Grand Portal, is hollowing out,
forming an immense cave, increasing every year.”</p>

<p>SAND ISLAND ARCH, LAKE SUPERIOR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“It is beyond the power of the pencil,” says a
recent traveler, “to represent the effect of the reflected
light in the roof as seen from the rear. Especially
when the sun is toward the west the bright light is
reflected from the waves into the cavern, and undulates
like a sea of light overhead; a picture in living colors,
so tender, so quiet—luminous, pearly grays, bright
flashes, cool, high lights, all warmed by the yellow
sandstone, dripping with water, on which the effect is
thrown.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At the mouth of Miner’s River the coast makes an
abrupt turn to the eastward, and just at the point where
the rocks break off and the sand beach begins, is seen
one of the grandest works of nature in her rock-built
architecture, which is known as ‘Miners’ Castle,’
from its singular resemblance to the turreted entrance
and arched portal of some old castle. The height of
the advancing mass, in which the form of the gothic
gateway may be recognized, is about seventy feet, while
that of the main wall forming the background is about one hundred and forty. The appearance of the opening at the base changes rapidly
with each change in the position of the spectator, and on taking a position a little to the right of that occupied by the sketcher, the central
opening appears more distinctly, flanked on either side by two lateral passages, making the resemblance to an artificial work still more
striking. The chapel, if not the grandest, is among the most grotesque of nature’s architecture here displayed. Unlike the excavations
before described, which occur at the water’s edge, this has been made in the rock at a height of thirty or forty feet above the lake. The
interior consists of a vaulted apartment, which has not inaptly received the name it bears. An arched roof of sandstone, from ten to twenty
feet in thickness, rests on four gigantic columns of rock, so as to leave a vaulted apartment of irregular shape, about forty feet in diameter,
and about the same in height. The columns consist of finely stratified rock, and have been worn into curious shapes. At the base of one
of them an arched cavity, or niche, has been cut, to which access is had by a flight of steps, formed by the projecting strata. The
disposition of the whole is such as to resemble, very much, the pulpit of a church; since there is, overhead, an arched canopy, and in front
an opening out towards the vaulted interior or the chapel, with a flat tubular mass in front, rising to a convenient height for a desk, while
on the right is an isolated block, which not inaptly represents an altar; so that, if the whole had been adapted expressly for a place of
worship, and fashioned by the hands of men, it could hardly have been arranged more appropriately. It is scarcely possible to describe
the singular and unique effect
of this extraordinary structure;
it is truly a temple of nature—‘an
house not made with
hands.’”</p>

<p>ABODE OF THE GENII, LAKE SUPERIOR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Pictured Rocks are
beautiful and fantastic at all
times, but it is in winter that
they are sublimely lovely, bewilderingly
grand, as photographs
taken by Mr. Childs, to
whom we are indebted for their
use here, will show. The falls
of Miners’ River are exquisite
when pouring over a brink
fringed with greenest foliage, but
when held in the vise-like grip
of winter they are magnificent
almost beyond conception.
They are a fitting prelude to the
spectatorium of cave wonders
near-by, such as the “Abode of
the Genii,” which might better
be called the “Throne-room of
Fairy Stalacta.” The water
percolating through the roof of
the caverns is frozen into the rarest, daintiest and most exquisite incrustations imaginable, some having the appearance of snow balls,
chrysanthemums and lilies, while others reach down their immense crystal points, as if trying to rest their ponderous weight upon the
opalescent floor. The “Cave-of-the-Winds” has a splendid entrance, and being shallow in depth is well lighted, so that the ice-covered
walls reflect the most gorgeous colors; but the congealed formations, while very beautiful, cannot compare with those that the Genii of
the neighbor grotto have appropriated. The splendors of these shores, however, are by no means confined to the caverns, for almost equally
curious and charming views are presented by the vertical faces of the snowy cliffs, upon which winter hangs the most magnificent draperies.
“The Cascade” is formed by the water flowing over a low bench along the shore, but at many points more curious effects are produced by
the fierce lashings of the lake that toss
showers of spray high up on the cliffs,
where it freezes into shapes peculiarly
wonderful and often radiantly beautiful.
“Peter’s Pillar” is a curious ice monument
formed by a little waterfall that
drops through a hole it has worn in the
bluff, but about the base are pretty ice
terraces and graceful corrugations, the
frozen spray cast from the shore-beating
waves of the angry lake.</p>

sufficiently curved to barely admit the
sight of a small opening at each end. At
this point the cliffs jut into the lake, and
in winter they are festooned and royally
embellished with lovely ice-forms of every
imaginable shape. A formation somewhat
similar is seen on “Sand Island” of the

have made an excavation through an arm
of the palisades sufficiently large to admit

<p>PETER’S PILLAR, LAKE SUPERIOR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The wonders of Lake Superior’s shores
do not terminate at Duluth, for the walls
rise to even a greater height on the north line and are of green sandstone
and porphyry, occasionally twelve hundred feet high. The St.
Louis River enters the lake from the northwest at Duluth; and though
this stream is barely deep enough to float a raft of logs, it runs between
lofty banks of the same general character as those which confine the
Great Lake. Enormous palisades line the north shore of Superior,
whose columns are so symmetrical as to equal the best productions of
the sculptor’s art. Pigeon River forms part of the boundary line
between Canada and the United States, and is a stream in great repute
with sportsmen, and also offers attractions to those who delight in
natural scenery of a sublime character. Pigeon Falls is but one of
many interruptions in its course towards the lake, the pool formed by
the dropping water being a favorite haunt for trout and salmon, while
in the numerous lakes near-by are myriads of water-fowls that have their
nesting-places on the shores. A few miles toward the east is Nipigon
River, another beautiful stream that connects a lake of the same
name with Superior. It is somewhat wider than Pigeon River, and its
shores are less bluffy; thus the current being less rapid, the stream is
diversified by many little islands that are so green with pines, hemlocks
and other trees as to look like emerald gems. But all along the
north shore are scenes of great beauty, and vast stores of mineral
wealth in iron and copper lie only a few feet beneath the surface; yet
notwithstanding all these attractions, the region is rarely visited save
by Indians and sportsmen.</p>

<p class='c011'>We reached St. Paul, after an absence of nearly one month,
and there met our photographer who had gone into the Black Hills in
quest of views. Being thus reunited, we started down the Mississippi,
but by rail, as the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad follows
the bank as far as La Crosse. Several stops were made, however, in
order to catch pictures of Fort Snelling, and the grand bluffs above
and below Winona, which for towering magnificence far exceed the
hills that render the Hudson famous. Indeed, considering the river
from St. Paul to Pepin Lake, the Mississippi’s shores present finer
scenery than is to be found along any other navigable stream on either
continent. But south of that point the views are rather monotonous
until Grafton is reached, where the Piasa Bluffs begin and run along
the river for twenty miles, exhibiting not only great vertical height,
but curious shapes, and at one point some very ancient Indian picture
writings.</p>

Our circuit of the West had now been completed, and having surrendered the camera car which we had chartered, we made hasty
preparations for a grand tour of all that section lying east of the Mississippi. Before departing for the East, however, we made a
flying trip over the St. Louis &amp; San Francisco Railroad to Eureka Springs, a popular health resort in Northern Arkansas, surrounded
by some very beautiful scenery that spreads away through the Ozark and Boston Mountains in picturesque grandeur, diversified by
swift-flowing streams, deep gorges, terrible bluffs and immense caves that are gorgeously embellished with gigantic stalactite and
stalagmite formations. If these magnificent scenes were not so conveniently near a large city, they would be a hundred-fold more
famous, for it is human nature to yearn for the least accessible and the most difficult of attainment. In short, we rarely appreciate the
things that we have, and exaggerate the importance and
attractiveness of places which are remote. It is this peculiarity
of the human mind that makes heaven a necessity and
immortality a natural deduction, the irresistible conclusion of
human reason.</p>

<p class='c011'>We tarried one week in St. Louis before departing for
the East, and then again divided our party, one of our photographers
proceeding to Pittsburgh, and thence through
Pennsylvania and Virginia, taking views of the famous
scenery of those States, while the other two whose travels we
will now describe, passed northward to Chicago, and thence
east by way of Niagara. Having heard much of a celebrated
point known as Starved Rock, on the Illinois River, a
place of commanding interest in the history of La Salle and
his adventurous companions, we resolved to stop at Ottawa, en
route to Chicago, and make a photograph of the historic rock.
We reached Ottawa by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy
Road, and thence by driving ten miles in a spring wagon we
gained the spot made celebrated through a tradition which is
as romantic as it is tragic.</p>

<p class='c011'>Starved Rock is now the property of a company, and is
situated on the left bank of the Illinois River, near the foot of
the rapids. It is a perpendicular bluff of limestone, one hundred and fifty feet high, and is crowned with oaks and other forest trees.
The water front presents a precipitous wall, but there is a slope towards an adjoining bluff by which it is alone accessible. The summit
has an area of about one acre, but is a natural stronghold; and perceiving its advantages, La Salle, on his first return trip to Canada,
ordered his Indian lieutenant, named Tonti, to fortify himself upon the Rock, supplying him with one small cannon for that purpose.
Tonti carried out these orders, and, it is said, died and was buried upon the Rock. Years afterward, the place became conspicuous in the
Indian wars; and it is related that after the killing of Pontiac, chief of the Ottawas, in a drunken row at Cahokia, some of his people
charged the Illinois tribe with the crime and made war upon them. Being feeble in numbers, they were driven before the Ottawas so
remorselessly that as a last resort they took refuge on Starved Rock. Here they were able to hold their enemies at bay, but their distress
was none the less because of their ability to prevent a scaling of their stronghold, for the Ottawas besieged the Rock and effectually
prevented the Illinois from securing any supplies. Water was for a while procured by means of vessels attached to ropes of bark, which
were let down into the stream. But this device was presently discovered and prevented by the Ottawas coming under the bluff in canoes
and cutting the ropes. Unwilling to surrender and run the risk of torture, the unfortunate Illinois remained in the place of their retreat
until one by one they died of starvation. This is the tradition current in La Salle county, and the finding of many Indian relics and
bones on the Rock tend to confirm its truthfulness.</p>

<p>BASIN SPRINGS, EUREKA SPRINGS, ARKANSAS.—<span class="multicaption">Arkansas is famous for her life-giving and health-supporting springs, and among these none are more celebrated than those at Eureka, in the northwestern part of the State. The location is picturesque and mountainous, the atmosphere clear and invigorating. A few years ago the place was a wilderness, and the waters wasted their treasures of good health in untrammeled mountain rivulets. By the merest accident their curative powers were discovered, and immediately the sick and the afflicted from all parts of the world began to flock thither, like pilgrims to a newly discovered Siloam. At present there is a thriving city of 4000 inhabitants located on the mountain sides, with many thousands of invalid guests constantly coming and going.</span></p>

<p>THE LOOKOUT, ON THE ROAD TO HOMER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From Chicago we went east over the Michigan Central to Niagara Falls, that greatest of natural wonders, a sublime apotheosis of
omnipotence, a glorification of the immeasurable
power that nature possesses, in whose
roar we distinguish the hallelujah chorus of
centuries and peans of praise to the mightiness
of Deity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Niagara Falls, the supreme natural marvel
of both continents, is divided into two cataracts,
viz.: American Falls, flowing towards
the American or western side, and Horseshoe
Falls, which discharges towards the Canada
side, the two being separated by Goat Island.</p>

<div  class='figright id016'>
<img src='images/i_347b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>BARN BLUFF, NEAR RED WING, MINNESOTA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The height of the former is one hundred and
four feet, and the latter, owing to a limestone
stratum not worn away, is one foot higher,
by which it is reasonably concluded that at
one time nearly all the flow was towards the
American side, because the discharge over
the western fall is not now so great as that
towards the Canada side. This tremendous
flood of waters is from Lake Erie through
Niagara River into Lake Ontario, and the
retrogression of the cataract, caused by the
wearing of the limestone ledge, inclines
geologists to the opinion that the flow has continued for a period of not less than thirty-seven thousand years. The width of Niagara
River at the falls is forty-five hundred feet, of which American Falls occupies eleven hundred feet, Goat Island fourteen hundred feet, and
Horseshoe Falls two thousand feet, though the deep curve in the latter, whence its name is derived, makes the line of fall more than three
thousand feet. It has been estimated that the discharge exceeds one billion gallons of water every twelve hours, and that the force thus
developed is equal to something more than one million horse-power.</p>

<p class='c011'>The landscape on either side of the falls has little of the picturesque or tumultuous about it, being generally slightly rolling, and
giving no indication of eruptive disturbance; so that scientists are still searching for a plausible theory upon which to base a conclusion as
to the cause that produced this sudden dip in the limestone formation.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>The astounding power displayed by the river dropping over a wide and lofty ledge is scarcely more bewildering than that
exhibited by the Rapids, which extend for half a mile from the point of descent, and meeting a swift current, the flood is lashed into a fury
that is frightful to behold, rising
in the center like huge
beasts in combat, and tossing
wave-caps nearly fifty feet
above the surface. At times
the spray rises in such clouds
as to completely obscure the
falls, and borne some distance
by the winds is condensed, and
a long-continued rain follows,
which renders a considerable
stay in the neighborhood somewhat
disagreeable.</p>

<p>AMERICAN FALLS, VIEWED FROM GOAT ISLAND.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>While an admirable view
of the falls may be obtained
from many points of observation
on the bridge, or along
both shores, the greatest interest
attaches to a visit to the
noisy caverns that are behind
the descending flood. These
may be reached by means of
spiral stairways built for the
purpose, but the visitor must
prepare for the trip by investing
himself in a suit of oil-skin,
and for a while must assume the
character of an amphibian. At
the bottom of the deep descent
are stones in great confusion,
over which we must scramble
to reach the Cave-of-the-Winds,
a watery grotto indeed, in
which the air is agitated by
the thundering cataract that
fairly envelopes you. The
scene here is beyond the scope of pen or brush, for these appeal only to sight and understanding, while the awful presence conjures all the
senses. Behind the giant curtain of waterfall is a greenish reflection, weird in its intensity and unnaturalness, and to the ears there comes
a muffled roar which, while not jarring,
yet seems to pervade and penetrate
like the dull rumble of an
earthquake. This uncertain disturbance,
which confuses with
strange noise, is intensified by a
wind that is here created by what appears
to be some mysterious agency;
and other curious things are noted
that suggest to the imaginative mind
a region of the supernatural, where
indistinct voices warn and then invite,
but are always clamorous, like
a crowd of bedlamites.</p>

<p class='c011'>Below the falls the river narrows
to eight hundred feet, between precipitous
walls, which add swiftness to
the current, and three miles from
Horseshoe Falls the impetuous stream
strikes a point of projecting land in
such a manner that a terrible whirlpool
is created, capable of sucking
down a large steamboat. By means
of a car, which is controlled by a
cable, visitors may ride down the
very steep incline to the edge of
Whirlpool Rapids and view in safety
the awful, mad-lashing waters,
swirling with extraordinary rapidity
and throwing high the tousled heads
of ravening waves, which appear to
be lusting for victims and bellowing
for vengeance. It is gratifying to
know that the almost incomputable
power of Niagara is soon to be transmitted,
through the generation of
electricity, to mills and machinery,
and thus utilized to the honor of
human genius as well as to the glory
of God.</p>

<p>NIAGARA FROZEN.—<span class="multicaption">Niagara is grand at any and all times, but if you would appreciate the sublimity of its grandeur in the fullest degree, you should visit it in winter, when it is covered with icy fringes and stalactites, and you can approach close to the roaring fountain on the mound of ice formed by the spray which rises from the foot of the precipice. It is only on rare occasions, during very severe winters, that such opportunities are afforded; but when they do occur they attract thousands of visitors from many sections, who come in crowds to witness a scene that has no equal among all the wonders of the world. On such occasions the Falls themselves seem to be a mass of liquid ice, while the shores, the trees and the cliffs are clothed in sheets of white, and made ornate with columns that rival alabaster in their transparent beauty.</span></p>

<p>BRIDAL VEIL FALLS, NIAGARA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Great changes occurring in Niagara Falls,
which though slow and remittent, are no less
certain to destroy the grandeur of that incomparable
waterfall some time in the very remote
future. It is a well-demonstrated fact that
Niagara River has excavated the gorge
through which it runs, and within recent
years such immense masses of the ledge-stone
have been detached by the gnawing waters
as to cause an appreciable recession of the
cataract, and a corresponding lengthening of
the gorge. It is recorded that in 1818 very
large fragments of limestone were wrenched
from the surface-bed and cast over Horseshoe
Falls, and another similar result occurred in
1855. But each year, and constantly, the
erosion is marked, so that Table Rock, formerly
a striking feature of the river, has been
worn away so completely that no present
sign of it now remains. It has been computed
by Sir Charles Lyell that the average
rate of recession is about one foot annually,
counting for the past thousand years; but as
before stated, the erosive results are spasmodic.
There is now eighty feet of hard
limestone composing the surface-rock, and it
will probably require ten thousand years for
the rushing waters to eat this away; after
that, however, the wear will be rapid, and in
course of centuries the falls will have disappeared,
and only a tremendous gorge will
remain in their stead. Many wonderful spectacles
have taken place at the falls, the most
interesting of which was the sending adrift
of a condemned lake vessel, drawing eighteen
feet of water, in 1829, which passed over the
brink without touching bottom, and was
dashed in pieces on the rocks below. This
experiment was made to test the depth of
water on the brink of the precipice.</p>

<p>HECTOR FALLS, WATKIN’S GLEN, IN WINTER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>There is a weary sameness to the generally level or prairie scenery which lies between the Mississippi River and New York State, if
we except the rather pleasing diversity of well-cultivated farms, prosperous towns, and evidences of thrift that are everywhere noticeable.
But there is more than the greatness of commercial and industrial empire to recommend New York to the sight-seer, for some of the most
charming scenery to be found anywhere in the world is within her borders, matching for sublimity even the most marvelous views which
we have described. And additional fascination attaches to many of her noted places on account of the Indian names which have been
jealously preserved in her geography.
The Mohawk Valley
is at once a lovely vale and a
reminder of Cooper’s “Leather
Stocking Stories;” and so are
her hundred rivers and lakes
that bear the designations bestowed
upon them, either by
some of the once-powerful
tribes, or which perpetuate the
fame of their great chiefs, the
shades of whom seem to linger
about Seneca, Cayuga, Oneida,
Oswego, Canandaigua, Chautauqua,
Keuka, Skaneateles,
over which they once skimmed
in light canoes. The romance
with which these beautiful
waters are invested would draw
us irresistibly to their shores
were there no other attractions;
but to these delightful traditions
of a vanished people are
the added charms of sylvan
glades, exposing vistas of exquisite
landscape, blue waters
dimpled by soft winds, swift-racing
streams dashing under
overarching shades, and wild
chasms that imprison echo and
exhibit some of the most astounding results of glacial action, abetted by upheaval, depression and erosion. After picturing the wonders
of Niagara, therefore, two of our party made a trip over the New York Central Line and its connection, to Geneva, a beautiful town
on the north shore of Seneca Lake, which in many respects is one of the most remarkable bodies of water in the world. The lake
is about forty miles in length, but it is a mere strip, rarely exceeding two miles in width, yet has the extraordinary depth of six
hundred feet, so that it is evidently a basin created by the same convulsion that wrought the surprising results which render the Glens at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>the south end famous beyond comparison, as will
be presently described. It is particularly strange
that such a tremendous cleft should be made
without showing a wider extent of disturbance,
though the shores are a succession of promontories,
sweeping back in graceful undulations and well-wooded
slopes, save where industry has converted
the hills into fruitful fields.</p>

<p>CAVERN CASCADE, WATKIN’S GLEN, IN WINTER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The trip from Geneva to Watkins, which
covers the extreme length of the lake, is comfortably
and enjoyably made by means of fine steamers,
which land at many intermediate points, and give
summer tourists opportunity for thoroughly examining
the towns and beautiful banks along the way.
Watkins, which is the objective place of all pleasure
travelers, has its feet bathed by Seneca Lake,
and its head shaded by the brow of Buck Mountain,
at whose base is the main street, running
parallel therewith. Following this street a short
distance, the visitor reaches a bridge that affords
passage over a small stream, and proceeding along
the banks of this little water-course for less than
half a mile, he is suddenly confronted by a massive
and lofty natural wall that prevents further progress.
Stairways, however, have been built, by
which we mounted to the summit of this wonderful
masonry, and from that eminence surveyed the
matchless scenery of Watkin’s Glen. But the view
is interrupted by intervening precipices and densely
wooded copses, so that to see the amazing wonders
and the bewildering beauties of this marvelously
diversified region a tour of its many attractions is
necessary. To do this requires a pair of strong
legs and good breath, for the climbing is severely
taxing, though owing to the substantial and well
protected stairways is never dangerous.</p>

In all the varied scenery of the world there is nothing to be compared to this, for here Nature seems to have done her utmost in fashioning something new and novel in the line of her handiwork for the admiration of mankind. At every footstep, for a distance of three miles along the gorge which cleaves the earth to a depth of 300 feet, some new wonder or marvelous creation is presented, each seemingly more superb than its neighbors.</span></p>

<p>WATKIN’S CASCADE FROZEN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Passing through Glen Alpha, where the
awful sublimity of a tremendous chasm oppresses
the visitor on first view, we caught sight of Twin
Falls, where the waters pour down in two great
sluices and become wedded in a swirling pool that pours out the overflow through a cañon whose walls have been scarified by the teeth of
centuries. Below the falls is Whirlpool Gorge, an amphitheater that is striated and terraced into forms so variable as to please every
conceit and yet arouse amazement.
The stream dashes into
this capricious auditorium at a
maddening pace, but encounters
resistance in the curving walls,
and is thus thrown into a rapid,
whirling movement like a maelstrom;
and this rotary action
of the waters has worn the
half-encircling walls into many
singular, though usually symmetrical
shapes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Climbing out of Whirlpool
Gorge and moving southward a
short distance along a railed
ledge, we come in sight of
Peek-a-boo Falls, a beautiful
sheet of water plunging over a
precipice fifty feet high, and
scattering its spray along the
walls that confine its descent,
for the chasm is very narrow
here, and charming for its sylvan
weirdness. The cliffs are
very pictures in stone, rising in
tiers and carved into fantastic
forms, while the overhanging
trees, graceful ferns and velvety
mosses make the place a bower
in which fairies might delight

<p>PORTLAND CASCADE, HAVANA GLEN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Though both Watkins and
Havana Glens are gems of nature
in summer-time, their rarest
robes of beauty are worn in
winter, when the Ice King takes
them in his embrace and bejewels them with crystals more exquisite than ever graced a royal bride. For the winter views which are here
presented we are indebted to other photographers, as we are also for the frost pictures of the Lake Superior coast, as our visit was made in
the summer-time. Examples of the sublime magnificence,
the divine-like embellishment of Watkin’s Glen,
when the lips of winter have kissed the noisy waterfalls
into frozen silence, are seen in the illustrations of Cavern
Cascade, and Hector Falls, and Watkin’s Cascade, where
the frost-sprites and the little children of the snow hide
beneath opalescent icicles and light the lamp of joy in
grottoes that open toward the voiceless gorge.</p>

<p class='c011'>Further up the chasm, where the broken fronts of
vertical walls begin, is a quiet retreat known as the
Council Chamber, spanned by a pretty bridge that is hung
upon opposite ledges and conducts to a passage that runs
along a shelf, then down a stairs to a path that leads
from the water’s edge to the town. The walls that enclose
this strip of river are exceedingly beautiful, built
up as they are with thin layers, of a few inches’ thickness,
each strata being very distinct, and the face of the cliffs
wrought into lovely shapes, with a shelf here and there as
if inviting lovers to seek them for the delightful seclusion
which they offer. The glen is about three miles in length,
and the walls frequently three hundred feet in height,
with enough variableness in the scenery to make it a
source of unwearying admiration.</p>

<p class='c011'>Three miles south of Watkin’s Glen, and properly a
continuation, for there is really a very brief interruption
in the rugged character of the valley, is Havana Glen,
quite as famous as its adjacent brother. The cliffs here
are scarcely so vertical, but the general formation is
practically the same, and similar means are provided for
viewing its wonders to advantage. Bridal Veil Falls is
Havana’s most alluring object, and well do they repay
the tourist for his visit. The water at this point falls
thirty feet down a very steep slope in a great column that,
contracted at the plunge, spreads as it flows over a succession
of terraces and dashes into the deep stream below
with sullen roar.</p>

<p>EAGLE FALLS, HAVANA GLEN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Portland Cascade is another charming fall, but the
chasm being wider at this point and broken by many
shelves, the water flows with less turbulence, though the
cascades are made more beautiful by spreading into thin,
veil-like sheets, so transparent that the wall
behind them is visible. A bridge is thrown
across the leaping stream, from which a glorious
view is had of the chasm as it winds
away towards the south, while the copse which
fringes the western edge constitutes a bower of
extraordinary loveliness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Eagle Falls, a hundred yards below the
cascades, is, perhaps, the most daintily exquisite
object in all this vale of natural wonders,
a very poem of beauty and charming
sequestration, where the brown cliffs sleep to the
lullaby of flowing waters, and the wild flowers
listen to the murmurs of the breeze. Stairs
lead to the brink, under overarching trees that
provide a delightful nook, but a more entrancing
view is obtainable from the bottom of the
charming dell into which the waters fall.
There is neither grandeur nor sublimity in the
sight afforded, but a soft witchery, a gentle
soul-rapture that is kin to inspiration in the
monody of the stream as it pours over the
ledge in a rhythm that is as musical as April
rain upon a cottager’s roof, and shimmers in
its fall like a lace curtain stirred by the wind.
Eagle Falls is plainly a misnomer, for the
name suggests a thing of prey. The Nymphs’
Bath is more appropriate, for here it would
seem that all the little people of the water and
the wood might find what Titania and Diana
longed for—a place of absolute seclusion,
“where the bright eyes of angels only might
behold a paradise so pure and lonely.”</p>

<p>COUNCIL CHAMBER, WATKINS GLEN, NEW YORK.—<span class="multicaption">This is one of the most imposing and impressive points of the Glen, and has been well named the Council Chamber. The walls that enclose this strip of river are exceedingly beautiful, built up as they are with thin layers, of a few inches’ thickness, each stratum being very distinct, and the face of the cliffs wrought into lovely shapes with shelving spaces here and there as if inviting lovers to seek them for the delightful seclusion which they offer. The chamber is spanned by a rustic bridge that is hung upon opposite ledges, affording a safe passage-way and a desirable point of view.</span></p>

<p>GIANT FALLS, AUSABLE CHASM.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Having feasted our sight, and caught the
spirit of inspiration that haunts the romantic
retreats of Havana Glen, we departed northward
and took a train on the Rome, Watertown
and Ogdensburg Railroad for Clayton, situated
on the south bank of the St. Lawrence River,
near where it receives the flow from Ontario
Lake. At this point steamer was taken for a ride
among the Thousand Islands to Ogdensburg, a trip
more charming than our remembrance of love’s first
dream. This part of the river is broken into many
channels that meander through avenues worn in the
granite which confines its course. The Thousand
Islands is no misnomer, for they seem to be beyond
number, scattered like a myriad of emeralds, with
deep water between, and yet so close together that
they may almost reach hands across the breach. Every
islet is a dome of rock, ground into symmetrical shape
by glacial action long ago, then covered by a sediment
from the river sufficient to support a profuse vegetation.
The Canada pine is conspicuous, lifting its
scraggy head to a great height, and pointing its stout
branches in every direction, a stately figure among the
brushwood that surrounds it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many of the islands are only little green dots
scarcely large enough for a fairy’s bower, while others
are of considerable size, occupied by lovely villas, the
resort of those wealthy enough to own beautiful summer
houses where the air is fragrant with sweetest odors,
and the gamest fish invite the enthusiastic angler.</p>

<p class='c011'>Departing from Ogdensburg, one of our party
proceeded to Montreal, by way of Ottawa, to photograph
some Canada scenery in the vicinity of those
cities, while the other took train for Chateaugay, each
mapping out for himself the work to be done in the
regions which he had chosen to picture. Chateaugay
is in the extreme northeastern part of New York and
about thirty miles from Lake Champlain. A river of
the same name flows by the place and through some
scenery which is almost matchless in marvelous grandeur,
probably excelling in extraordinary cleavage that
found in Watkin’s and Havana Glens. Giant Gorge is
one of the first tremendous rents which we observe
in the chasms of Chateaugay River, but several other
precipitously walled cañons occur between that point
and Chateaugay Lake, twenty miles below, where
the Adirondack Mountain region begins, with its
wilderness of untamable savagery, as wild now as when its rugged solitudes were first disturbed by an invading Indian seeking the game
that there abounded. This darksome haunt of nature is cleft by the Saranac, Raquette, Boquet and Ausable Rivers, and in these gloomy
recesses whence the day is dispelled are the lake sources of the noble Hudson.</p>

The cliffs are scarcely so vertical, but the general formation is practically the same, and similar means are provided for viewing its wonders to advantage. Bridal Veil Falls are Havana’s chief attraction, and they merit the distinction. The water at this point falls thirty feet down a very steep slope, in a great column, which, contracted at the plunge, spreads as it flows over a succession of terraces until it dashes into the deep stream below with a sullen roar.</span></p>

<p>ELBOW FALLS, AUSABLE CHASM.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Crossing over to Lake Champlain, we took a Delaware and Hudson Railroad train at Plattsburgh and rode down to Port Kent and
thence visited Ausable Chasm near-by. Indian Pass is also in the same vicinity. The scenery is a repetition of that in Watkin’s Glen,
with the added interest of a
more considerable stream, upon
which boating is a royal pleasure.
The freshness which
description by another writer
may furnish is my excuse for
introducing the following from
the pen of Alfred B. Street:</p>

<p class='c011'>“At North Elba we crossed
a bridge where the Ausable
comes winding down, and then
followed its banks to the northeast,
with thick woods continually
around us, and the little
river shooting darts of light at
us through the leaves. At
length, a broad summit, rising
to a taller one, broke above the
foliage at our right, and at the
same time a gigantic mass of
rock and forest saluted us, and
we stood before the giant portals
of the Notch. As we
entered, the pass suddenly
shrank, pressing the river into
a deep and narrow stream. It
was a chasm cloven boldly
through White-Face, so that on
each side towered the mountain
escarpment; on the left, the
range rose in still sublimer altitude, with grand precipices, like a majestic wall or a line of palisades, climbing sheer from the half-way
forest upward. The crowded rows of pines along the broken and wavy crest were diminished to a mere fringe. As we rowed slowly
through the still narrowing gorge, the mountains soared higher and higher, as if to scale the clouds, presenting truly a terrific aspect. I
shrank within myself, and appeared to dwindle beneath it. Something akin to dread pervaded the scene. The mountains appeared to be
knitting their brows into threatening frowns at our daring intrusion into the solitudes. Nothing seemed native to the awful landscape but
the plunge of the torrent and the scream of the eagle. Below, at our left, the dark Ausable dashed onward with hoarse, foreboding
murmurs, in harmony with the loneliness and wildness of the spot.”</p>

<p>THE SUMMIT OF WHITE-FACE MOUNTAIN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From the top of Mount Marcy, overlooking Indian Pass, the view is inspiring in its expansive and tumultuous grandeur. Towards
the southeast gleams the white crest of Boreas Mountain, and rising beyond is the leaning tower-like peak of the Dial, which pays its
obeisance to Dix’s Peak, that from afar exhibits the form of a crouching lion. “Thence stagger the wild, savage and splintered tops of
Gothic Mountain, at the Lower
Ausable Pond, linking themselves
on the east with the
Noon-Mark and Roger’s Mountains,
that watch over Keene’s
Valley. To the northeast rise
the Edmonds Pond Summits—the
mountain-picture closed by
the sharp crest of Old White-Face,
the stately outpost of the
Adirondacks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A trip through Ausable
Chasm is one of unspeakable
delight and enrapturing surprises.
Just above the point
where the chasm begins there
is an old mill, once run by a
wheel driven by a sluice connected
with the river, but steam
has superseded this natural
power and detracted somewhat
from the interest which would
otherwise invest the place.
The dam is still there, however,
and over its brink the
water flows in softest measures,
to strike the rocky shelves below,
where it boils and brawls
in confused dismemberment until
joined again in an unbroken
stream. The banks rise rapidly, while the river draws deeper into its bed, until presently making a leap at Giant Falls it plunges into a
great gorge whose walls have been eaten by the floods and ice of centuries. But it is by a succession of falls and cataracts that the stream
reaches its greatest depression, which is known as the Grand Flume. Elbow Falls scarcely deserve to be dignified by so large a title, as
they are rapids rather than falls; but for beauty they are almost incomparable, and afford an opportunity for the painter’s brush as great as
may be found anywhere in the Adirondacks.</p>

The dam, originally built upon the rapids, is still there, however, and over its brink the water flows in softest measures, falling upon the rocky shelves below, where it boils and broils in confused dismemberment until joined again in an unruffled stream a few yards below.

<p class='c011'>The chasm rapidly deepens and narrows below
Elbow Falls, and becomes a wild gorge of intricate
mightiness at a point called the Oven. The walls are
lifted so high above the stream, with their crenated
fronts exhibiting so many quaintly distorted and terribly
jagged projections that the effect is most bewildering, while in places they are opposed with only a few feet between, giving to the passage
the oppression of a prison. Hell Gate is not inappropriately named, because it is in a way begirt with difficulties that render boating
dangerous. The river is here greatly compressed, but the channel is not sufficiently deep to hide the sharp-pointed rocks that split the
stream and convert it into a rapid, but by means of stairs this interrupted water-way may be passed, and below are boats in which
the pleasant passage may be continued through Grand Flume. This is the loveliest part of the chasm, the most picturesque section of this
wonderful river, sublime in its
grandeur, yet idyllic in its poetic
and dreamy beauty, where the

<p class='c011'>From Ausable station,

a road leads southward through
Ausable Forks, by White-Face

This remarkable tract lies principally
between Lakes Champlain
and George, and covers
an area of nearly 5,000 square
miles, with one arm reaching
northward to the St. Lawrence
and another southward as far
as Saratoga. Within this district
there are said to be no less
than 500 mountain peaks,
several of which are 5,000 feet
high, measured above the sea
level, and as many as 1,000
lakes. Owing to the ruggedness of the country, its dense forests, numerous water-ways and prodigious chasms, the region was a comparatively
unexplored wilderness forty years ago, and until its vast lumber interest attracted the attention of capitalists.</p>

the best now to be found anywhere in the United States, abounding as it does in deer, bear, panther, wolf, wolverene, and immense numbers
of smaller game, so that whether lost or found, a man with a loaded gun need never go hungry in the Adirondacks.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not surprising that a region noted for its mountains, lakes and dense forests, should abound with features magnificently
picturesque; and those who
visit the Adirondacks in search
of the wildest beauties of nature
will not make the trip in vain.
It is the Switzerland of America,
equaling the best scenery of
that country, and exceeding it
in some respects, notably its
intricate chain of lakes, its
flaming chasms, and the solitudes
of its deep wildernesses,
so tangled and intricate that
more than two-thirds remain

in these fastnesses is inexpressibly
doleful and at times fearful.
The Black Forest of Germany
is not nearly so lonely, nor is
the Brocken so ominous with
its colossal specter as the mountain
summits of the Adirondacks,
clothed with evergreens and
groves of birch, maple, beech,
ash and cedar, in which the
bear, wolf and wild-cat have
their lairs. In these wild seclusions,
the recesses of dark
valleys and the dreary isolation
of soaring peaks, darkness is
enthroned and veiled by shadows,
amid which savage animals
and dusky night-birds hold their
carnivals. The catamount sets
up a chilling wail that brings
response from the deep-voiced loon that keeps his lonely watch on a lake far below; then across a stretch of deep wood falls the hooting
echo of a solemn owl, whose complainings excite condolement of whip-poor-will and katydid, and the chorus thus begun is taken up and joined
in by a thousand whimpering, screeching, strident and wailing things that make the lonesome forest their assembling place.</p>

<p>RAINBOW FALLS IN WINTER, ADIRONDACKS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>But when the sun is above the mountains and setting the landscape aglow with cheerful beams, these same fastnesses are a realm of
romantic delight, for every peak is reflected in some lovely lake, while waterfalls appear to be pouring out of the sky and go chasing down
the verdant slopes playing high-spy among the coverts and making the woods musical with their laughter. Near Ausable Ponds, guarded
by Mount Marcy, are the beautiful Rainbow Falls, a very flood of opals, so iridescent does it appear when its waters catch the sunbeams.
And near Tupper Lake are the Bogg’s River Falls, or cascades, that make the surrounding forest resound with their roaring, for they discharge
an immense flood over a rock-infested course, and swell into a river a mile below.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the western margin of the Adirondacks is Long Lake, narrow as a river and many miles in length, but so still and crystalline
that the lordly lake-trout may be seen
sporting in its deepest water, as if challenging
an angler. Its outlet is by way
of a stream that flows by Owl’s Head
and into Forked Lake. Between these
points is Buttermilk Falls, stately and
impetuous, but symmetrical and rhythmic,
as it courses over gentle terraces and
drops, step by step, into the rapids which
crowd from shore to shore and keep the
stream in a state of constant agitation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Northeast of Buttermilk Falls is
Adirondack station, on Henderson Lake,
which is the central point of this whole
mountain region, and a place where
tourists are usually found in large numbers.
Near the north end of the lake is
Wall-Face Mountain, commanding an
extensive view, and midway is Indian
Pass, which is a tremendous chasm
through what is known as the Dismal
Wilderness. Notwithstanding the large
number of visitors who annually summer
in the vicinity, so dense is the forest and
jungle-growth that surrounds the Pass,
and so inaccessible the deepest portions
of the gorge, that very few explorers have succeeded in making their way through it, and no one is sufficiently familiar with the region to
act as a competent guide. It has been ascertained, however, that within the Pass, which is intersected by several streams, are springs
which are the source of Ausable River, which, emptying into Champlain, finds an outlet into the Atlantic by way of the St. Lawrence, and
also of the Hudson, whose drainage is in the opposite direction; and yet so close are these springs that it is possible to drink from each
without shifting one’s position. In this vicinity is Gill Brook, which is picturesquely broken by Surprise Falls, composed of a
succession of sharp leaps over limestone ledges, but so narrow that the forest trees form a perfect canopy above, excluding a sight of both
river and falls until the visitor approaches within a few feet of the stream. But the entire region so abounds with lakes, mountains, gorges,
waterfalls and cataracts that to describe all its attractions would be wearisome iteration, for there is an unavoidable sameness in the pen-pictures
of scenery, however variable in character.</p>

<p>BRIDGE OVER GLEN’S FALLS, NEW YORK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Having made a tour of the Adirondacks, and taken many photographs of the superb scenery which distinguishes it, we took train at
Saranac Lake station, the southern
terminus of the Chateaugay
Railroad, and returned to Plattsburgh.
From that point we
proceeded south by the Delaware
and Hudson Railroad,
along the west shore of Champlain,
by Ticonderoga, and
thence to Glen’s Falls, to obtain
a picture of the Hudson where
it pours over rocky ledges in
great volume and is converted
into a terrible cataract that is
worth many miles of travel to
see. Our way was then continued
southward to Albany,
and thence into the Catskills,
which begin about one hundred
miles south of the Adirondacks.
These mountains are unlike
any others in America, in that
while every other range possesses
peaks with jagged points,
generally of stones tumbled in
confusion, the Catskills have
gracefully rounded summits,
which, though sometimes rising
to a height of four thousand
feet, yet exhibit few effects of
aberrant forces; nor are they
covered with huge rocks, such
as characterize all other ranges.
The scenery, therefore, while
grand, is very tame as compared
with the Adirondacks, and but for the fine drive-ways through the valleys and over their crowns, would be monotonous. But this
sameness is occasionally diversified, and the visitor is led on to expect more beauties than he really finds. The one attractive and justly
famous feature of this mountain region is Kaaterskill Falls. These are reached by the Catskill Mountain Railroad from Catskill, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>Hudson, stopping at Mountain House station, from which eminence, 2,250 feet above the river, an extensive view may be had, taking in
Albany, the Hudson Highlands, Berkshire Hills and the Green Mountains. It is even said that by means of a good glass on a clear day
portions of Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey may be descried, but during our visit the atmospheric conditions were unfavorable.
Two miles from the Mountain House, and reached by a beautiful road, are the celebrated Kaaterskill Falls, at the head of which is located
the Laurel House, from which
a fine view of Round Top and
High Peak may be had, as well
as of the falls themselves. But
the best sight is obtained by
descending a spiral stairway
into the gorge below and looking
upward. The falls are
formed by the overflow of North
and South Lake, which pours
through a double cleft and descends
in two cascades, the first
having a drop of 180 feet, and
the second eighty feet; but a
short distance below there is
another fall, known as the Bastion,
which has a further descent
of forty feet. Beautiful as they
are, candor compels the statement,
however disparaging it
may appear, that the falls are
remittent, and that people may
visit them without seeing any
such display of waters as we
have described. The supply
being limited, a dam has been
constructed across the verge of
the cliff, and is opened only on
special and rare occasions, when
the number of incredulous summer
visitors is great enough to
make it necessary to turn on
the water, to show that the falls
are still active. There is some very pretty scenery in the region of Kaaterskill Clove, notably Hains’ Falls, Fawn-Leap Falls and High
Rocks, but a fee is charged at every point of interest, and the visitor is so harrowed by the showmen of nature that he is in no disposition to
appreciate the view which he pays to see, and is almost certain to leave the Catskills with a bad impression—even worse than the mountains

stopped for a while at West Point en route.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>LOOKING NORTH FROM WEST POINT, NEW YORK.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The scenery about West Point is of almost matchless grandeur, and every consideration is present to confirm the wisdom of the
Congress of 1812 in establishing a military training-school at this point. The fort on the river-shore is in a position to command the
approaches north and south, while at the foot of the highlands is a level stretch, as though prepared by nature for a Champ des Mars, or
parade-ground. The hills rise abruptly from the rear of the training-plaza, and from their summits an inspiring view is to be had.
Sweeping the horizon, we clearly discern the Break-Neck, Crow’s Nest, and Storm King Mountains, with blue valleys stretching away
between, and the majestic Hudson washing the feet of these and many other noble hills. The academy, besides being scenically and
advantageously situated, is in a very
realm of romance, around which cluster
many memories of the greatest writers
of fiction that our country has the honor
of claiming. It was the Crow’s Nest
that gave the inspiration to Joseph
Rodman Drake for his exquisite poem
entitled the “Culprit Fay,” so charmingly
realistic that the fairies of his
verse still exist in fancy, just as the
mountain spirits who tricked Rip Van
Winkle still haunt the deep forests of
the Catskills and play at nine-pins on the
peak that overlooks the faded village of
Falling Water. Near Cold Spring,
which is in this same historic land, was
“Undercliff,” the home of George P.
Morris, and where he wrote that patriotic
and moving tribute to a sheltering
tree, the figure of our American Union,
“Woodman, Spare that Tree.” So was
“Idlewild,” the villa of N. P. Willis,
close-by, and hereabout also Washington
Irving spent much of his time gathering
traditions from descendants of the
old Dutch colonists for his imperishable “Sketch Book” tales. But history as indelibly fixes West Point in the minds of Americans as the
stories of famous fiction-writers, for the site of the training-school was, in Revolutionary times, occupied by Fort Putnam, erected under
the direction of Kosciuszko; and it was at West Point that Benedict Arnold consummated his traitorous deal with Major Andre, to deliver
that post into the hands of the British. On the opposite shore is the mouth of a pretty stream called the Mooda, but which in earlier
times was known as Murderer’s Creek, on account of the slaughter by a band of lurking savages of eight soldiers who were sent with
buckets to fetch water for the camp near-by. A little way below is Milton’s Ferry, a spot famous as the place of residence of a patriot
blacksmith who made the great chain that stretched across the river at old Fort Montgomery, to prevent the passage of British ships. For
this service he was taken captive shortly after and kept in close confinement on an English ship until his death. Newburgh is also only a
few miles away, smiling benignly from terraced banks upon the river below; and conspicuous among its old houses is one in which Washington
had his headquarters in 1780, and which is changed but little in appearance since he occupied it.</p>

<p>BREAK-NECK HILL, ON THE HUDSON RIVER, NEW YORK.—<span class="multicaption">Break-Neck Hill is on the east side of the Hudson, north of West Point, and is a continuation of the Highlands. It is 1220 feet high, and one of the most commanding features of the splendid scenery of this region. Its rock-ribbed and serrated sides present a scene of imposing grandeur as they are observed from the decks of passing steamers; and in the summer season, when the sloping sides, from the water’s edge to the summit, are clothed in emerald green, with the gray rocks peeping out here and there, disclosing shaded nooks and sylvan glades where the birds sing and the squirrels play and frolic, the scene is inspiring enough to arouse the enthusiasm of a stoic.</span></p>

<p>TROPHY GARDEN, WEST POINT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is below West Point that the principal places of scenic and historic interest occur, and these crowd rapidly upon one another until
Yonkers is reached. At the base of Sugar-Loaf Mountain is a bluffy projection upon which Fort Independence, of Revolutionary times,
was built, and near-by is Buttermilk
Falls, that runs down a
succession of sharp ledges one
hundred feet. Anthony’s Nose
is on the right, rising to a
height of nine hundred feet,
and overlooking beautiful Ionia
Island, that seems to swim upon
the glassy surface of the river,
like the halcyon isle of fable;
but on close approach its three
hundred acres are found to be
covered with vineyards and its
shaded margins the favorite
gathering-place of merry picnickers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Highlands come next
in view, of which Dunderberg
Mountain, eleven hundred feet
high, is the most prominent
object; and then appears Peekskill,
the prettiest town in eastern
New York. Near this
place is Caldwell’s Landing,
distinguished as being the immediate
vicinity of Captain
Kidd’s buried treasure, which
hundreds have searched for with
great energy and at immense
expense, but without reward.
Remains of Revolutionary forts are seen at Verplanck and Stony Point, and below these the Croton River discharges into the Hudson. Sing
Sing and Nyack are passed in order, between which the shores are occupied with charming villas, and the landscape here is very picturesque.
But it is at Tarrytown that visitors find most to interest them, both for the scenic beauty of the neighborhood and the historic prominence
which attaches to the place. Here it was that Major Andre was arrested, the identical spot being marked by an inscription in the village
records. The spirit of Washington Irving seems to pervade the locality, for it was in this vicinage that the creatures of his exquisite fancy
held their lively revels. Sleepy Hollow is near-by, and
the old bridge over which Ichabod Crane so furiously rode
in his flight from a headless specter is still shown to visitors
as a proof of that legendary race. The Christ Church
which Irving attended in Tarrytown has not been suffered
to lapse into decay, and the cemetery adjoining the old
Dutch church, in which his remains find rest, shows the
reverend respect with which his memory is treasured by
the villagers, for it is well tended.</p>

<p>STORM-KING MOUNTAIN, HUDSON RIVER.—<span class="multicaption">Storm-King is above West Point and on the same side of the river. It soars to a height of 1529 feet, commanding from its lofty summit a magnificent view of what is perhaps the finest scenic region of the world. At its feet reposes the lovely vale of Tempe, a modest stretch of green meadow-land covered with gardens and rustic homes, where the weary merchant and the harassed broker may find relief from the turmoil and the busy rush of city life. Since our photograph was taken an immense cantilever bridge has been thrown across the river at this point, which, while it is a splendid and beautiful example of modern engineering, is nevertheless an impediment to the artistic features of the scenery.</span></p>

<p>LONG GALLERY, AUSABLE CHASM.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Wolfert’s Roost,” or Sunnyside, Irving’s villa, is a
few miles below, just within the edge of Irvington, on the
river, but it is hidden from view by the ivy that clambers
in profusion over its walls, and the dense shrubbery that
has been allowed to occupy all the ground in the front-yard.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old town of Tappan is a short distance from
Sunnyside, and is memorable as being Washington’s headquarters
and likewise as the place of Major Andre’s imprisonment
and execution. A monument erected by Cyrus
Field marks the spot where the gallows stood on which
that English officer perished. The Palisades next come
into view, and on the west side is Locust Hill, which was
the place where the American encampment was established
in 1781, along the eminences of the Palisades
which gave a commanding position to the troops guarding
against invasion of the British up the river. Yonkers,
Spuyten Duyvil, and Mount St. Vincent are next passed,
and the city of New York then looms up, with its wharves
lined with vessels, whose numerous masts make the shores
look from a distance like a forest of pines denuded of
their branches. Here we tarried to await the coming of
our two photographers.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the meantime, however, there were no idle moments,
for the work of developing the photographs which
we had taken was now prosecuted with great energy, and
the finished pictures were sent on as fast as made to our
photo-engravers for reproduction. Fortunately, too, we
had so accurately timed the work which each had undertaken
that there was only a few days’ detention in New
York; little more, in fact, than was necessary to complete
arrangements for our tour of the South, now to be described.</p>

As explained in the preceding chapter, one of our photographers was despatched into Canada from Ogdensburg, and instructed to
take views of the most pleasing scenery of the Dominion, after which to make a tour of the Eastern States and join the others at
New York upon the completion of his labors in that section. While Canada is not a part of the United States, its contiguous
scenery, some of which is very beautiful, and the intimate relations subsisting between the two countries justify this brief departure
from our original design, particularly as the most direct route from the West to Northern New Hampshire and Vermont, is
through the southern part of Canada, where the most interesting and accessible scenery is found. Crossing the St. Lawrence at
Ogdensburg to Prescott, our artist proceeded to Ottawa, fifty-four miles distant, by the Canadian Pacific Railroad, for the purpose of taking
views of Chaudiere Falls, which are famous alike for their size and grandeur.
The city of Ottawa extends for a distance of two miles along Ottawa River,
and is one of the most picturesque sites in Ontario, located as it is on the
banks of a beautiful stream, and in the center of a region that is famous for
its charming scenery. The Rideau River debouches into the Ottawa at
Chaudiere (Caldron) Falls, and its bluffy shores, 160 feet high, are ornate
with splendid buildings. The Rideau Canal, which skirts the east side of
Parliament Hill, separates the higher from the lower town, and south of this
point is the vast lumber interests, manifested by the large number of saw-mills
operated principally by power derived from the falls. But it is about Chaudiere
Falls that chief attraction clusters, particularly of visitors, for a more
entrancing sight can hardly be found in any part of North America. Ottawa
River is a stream of considerable magnitude, both in width and depth, but at
the point where the falls appear it is contracted to a width of 200 feet and then
plunges over a precipice forty feet high, at the mouth of Rideau River. But
the verge of the ledge is so ragged and curved that the stream is broken, and
pours down in a swirling motion, which forms a very charybdis below, into
which it is dangerous for crafts to enter. The volume discharged is almost as
great as that of Niagara, and the power displayed is wonderful to behold.
Beautiful, grand and amazing as they are in summer, it is during winter that
the sublime magnificence of the falls is impressed upon the visitor. Several
views, from different points of observation, were taken by our photographer,
but these were rejected to give place to the winter scene here presented, since
it affords a more perfect idea of the falls in their glory, when the Ice King has
frozen them into a vision of superlative splendor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Three hundred miles northeast of Ottawa, Montreal River, a small but
noisy stream that is the outlet of a chain of lakes far up in the British possessions,
flows into the Ottawa River, and twenty miles above its mouth are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>Montreal Rapids, a picture of which was
obtained from a local photographer at Ottawa,
and is here reproduced as affording an idea of
the scenery in that great northern and almost
unexplored region.</p>

<p>TOBOGGAN SLIDE AT MONTREAL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From Ottawa the trip was continued by
boat one hundred miles to Montreal. This
route affords a view of Lake St. Louis, Nun’s
Island, and Lachine Rapids, the most dangerous
part of St. Lawrence River, yet it is
every day traversed by pleasure steamers, of
which a traveler has thus graphically written:
“In the descent of these rapids we are wrought
to a feverish degree of excitement, exceeding
that produced in the passage of the Long
Sault. It is an intense sensation, and though
perfectly safe, is terrible to the faint-hearted,
exhilarating to the brave. Opposite Lachine
is the quaint Indian village of Caughnawago,
where still reside descendants of the once-powerful
Iroquois Nation. The immense steel
bridge spanning the St. Lawrence at this point
is justly considered one of the engineering
triumphs of the century. It was built by the
Canadian Pacific Railway, is about a mile
long, with two channel spans of 408 feet, and
lofty enough to allow free passage to the
largest steamers. From this bridge a fine
view is obtained of the rapids, villages on either
shore, loftiest structures in Montreal, and the
distant mountains.”</p>

<p>MONTMORENCI FALLS, NEAR QUEBEC.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Montreal is the metropolis of Canada,
having a population of about 220,000, and
being at the head of ship navigation, has
improved its advantages and become the chief
commercial port of the Dominion. The name
is derived from Mount Royal, which rises 700
feet above the river, the eminence which
Jacques Cartier ascended in 1535, and looked
with startled eyes upon the palisaded Indian
town of Hochelaga, surrounded by vast fields
of grain, at the west base of the mountain.
Sixty years later, when Samuel de Champlain
made his way up the St. Lawrence and
climbed to the summit of Mount Royal, he
looked in vain for the town which Cartier had
discovered and described. Only two of the
native Indians of Hochelaga were found, from
whom was learned the tragic history of the
place, the inhabitants of which had been
exterminated and the town destroyed by a rival
tribe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Montreal is situated on an island of the
same name, and the eminences about it were
so important as vantage-places that during the
French and Indian wars (in 1665), the mount
was fortified by the French, and in 1722 a
citadel was erected on a height now laid out as
Dalhousie Square. In its early history, therefore,
the city was the scene of many incidents
of Indian warfare, and was on disputed ground
until the surrender of Quebec, in 1759, when
the English gained permanent possession of
the place.</p>

<p>REPRESENTATIONS OF WINTER CARNIVAL SCENES AT MONTREAL.—<span class="multicaption">Winter is the carnival season at Montreal, and for some years the city has been specially distinguished by the brilliant fêtes which her leading citizens have provided, notably that of 1888. On this occasion there were many scenes of extraordinary splendor, exceeding, in the magnificent sights afforded, the carnivals that take place on the frozen waters of the Neva River, before the Russian capital of St. Petersburg, famous alike in song and story.

<p>ST. ANNE FALLS, NEAR QUEBEC.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The scenery in the neighborhood of
Montreal is pleasant, but not particularly
attractive; yet the severity of the weather and
the long reaches of graceful hills thereabout
afford opportunity for the most enjoyable
winter sports. Tobogganing is a favorite pastime
in season, and the most charming scenes
imaginable may be witnessed by a visit to the
west side slide when a heavy snow has prepared
the ground for the host of red-cheeked
merry-makers, who flock there by thousands
with their toboggans, and fly down the hill in
long lines of variegated color. Winter is the
carnival season, and for some years Montreal
has been specially distinguished by the brilliant
fetes which her leading citizens have provided
notably that of 1888. On this occasion the
city was a scene of extraordinary splendor,
exceeding, in the magnificent sights afforded,
the carnivals that take place on the frozen
waters of the Neva River, before the Russian
capital of St. Petersburg, famous alike in song
and story. The great ice-palace, of which an
illustration is here given, was a most exquisite
imitation of mediæval architecture, rivaling in
its imposing and charming appearance the
finest castles of the old world. When illuminated
by thousands of lights, the palace presented
a scene which must ever remain fadeless
in the memory of those who witnessed it.
But to increase the beautiful effect, the city’s
population turned out in the gayest of winter
attire, filling the spacious ball-room of the
palace with a marvelous display of color in
graceful evolution, while outside the gay
revelers sported as jolly maskers and filled the
air with songs of glee. A similar carnival
was held at St. Paul in 1889, and an ice-palace
of equal proportions was constructed in honor
of the Frost King, with grand illuminations
and display of fire-works at night, as illustrated
in a previous chapter, but no fete ever
given on the western continent is believed to
have been so magnificent as that of Montreal
in 1888.</p>

<p>WINOOSKI FALLS, VERMONT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From Montreal the journey was continued
over the Canadian Pacific Railroad to Quebec,
distant one hundred and thirty-five miles, and
along the north shore of the St. Lawrence,
in sight of that river most of the way, so that
the view is a very attractive one. Quebec, the
third largest city in the Dominion of Canada,
with a population of 70,000, has much to
recommend it, both commercially and scenically,
for it is the center of vast lumber and
mining interests, the head of navigation for
the largest steamers of the line,
and is advantageously located on
a headland commanding the St.
Lawrence. A large part of the
city lies under what is known as
Cape Diamond Promontory, upon
the summit, of which, 350 feet
above the river, is the Citadel, a
fortification so nearly impregnable
that Quebec has been called the
American Gibraltar, a designation
more deserved because of the
many attacks which its garrisons
have repulsed. The Plains of
Abraham are southwest of the
suburb of St. Louis, and from that
eminence a wide and truly magnificent
view is obtained, extending
to the Green Mountains on the
south and the Laurentian Range
on the north, with glimpses of numerous
rivers and lakes between.</p>

<p class='c011'>The entire province of Quebec
is remarkably well watered and
timbered, with sections of forests
so dense that much of it still remains
to be explored. Eight
miles from the city are the famous
Montmorenci Falls, which have a
leap over natural steps of 250 feet
and pour down an immense volume,
whose roaring may be heard
on calm days for a distance of
many miles. Near the falls is a
hotel called the Haldimand House,
which was once the residence of
Queen Victoria’s father, the Duke
of Kent. Sixty miles north,
and reached by the Quebec and
Lake St. John Railroad, is Lake
St. John, a large and pellucid body of water whose outlet is the
Saguenay River, and one of the most wonderful streams on earth.
Bayard Taylor says of it: “It is not properly a river, but a tremendous
chasm, like that of the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea, cleft for
sixty miles through the heart of a mountainous wilderness. Everything
about it is hard, naked, stern, silent. Dark-grey cliffs of granite
gneiss rise from the pitch-black water; firs of gloomy green are rooted
in their crevices and fringe their summits; loftier ranges of a dull
indigo hue show themselves in the background, and over all bends a
pale, cold, northern sky.”</p>

<p>A SYLVAN STREAM IN VERMONT.—<span class="multicaption">Vermont is rich in scenery as well as historic and classic associations. The Green Mountains, extending through the entire State from north to south, with their many spurs and outlying peaks, and the numerous lakes and small streams in the intervening valleys, afford a variety of scenery of the most pleasing and picturesque character. There is a wealth of splendid views along the Winooski River, whose source is in the spurs of the Green Mountains, whence it flows northwestwardly, cleaving the range near its junction with the Waterbury River, and then speeds through a wild gorge until it empties into Lake Champlain a few miles distant.</span></p>

<p>PEACOCK FALLS, GREEN MOUNTAINS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The Saguenay is sometimes called the River of Death, on account
of its sombre waters and the deep gorge through which it sluggishly
moves. Its depth is also remarkable, ranging from 100 to 1000 feet,
and along its course are several pretty falls, where the stream suddenly
contracts, and rapids where it expands and the occasional shoals appear.
The country about Quebec is pleasingly diversified, and abounding with
forests and lakes is a very paradise for hunters and fishers, as well as
affording views worthy of the artist’s best efforts. Some ten miles
above the city, and forming an outlet for Lake Megantic, on the south
side of the St. Lawrence, is Chaudiere, or Boiling River, an impetuous,
but noble stream, whose erratic course is interrupted by Chaudiere
Falls, where the river takes a plunge over a precipice 125 feet
high and 350 feet wide. Having expended its vigor in this violent
exercise, the river flows on thenceforth in a subdued and gentle
manner, in remarkable contrast with the character which it displays
above the falls.</p>

<p class='c011'>Other famous falls in the vicinity of Quebec are those of the
Scuzzie, near North Bend, and St. Anne Falls, on the north shore of
the St. Lawrence, twenty miles below the city, where the river St.
Anne, a small confluent of that stream, breaks over a brink one hundred
feet high, and pours through crevices worn in the Laurentian rocks
in a succession of cascades of great beauty. While the scenery of
Southern Canada is very charming, it is the boundary outposts of very
much more magnificent landscapes towards the south, and it was
towards the mountainous districts of Vermont and New Hampshire
that our artist bent his way after concluding a tour of the vicinity of
Quebec. The journey was, therefore, by way of the Grand Trunk and
Vermont Central Railroad into the heart of Green Mountains. This
route took our photographer by the Enosburgh Falls, St. Albans and
Essex Junction, from which latter place a detour was made down the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>famous Winooski River to embalm some of the remarkable scenery along that stream. Its source is in the spurs of Green Mountains,
whence it flows northwestwardly, cleaving the range near its junction with Waterbury River, and then speeds through a chasm until it
empties into Lake Champlain. This wild gorge is particularly wonderful some four or five miles from the lake, the walls rising at places
fully one hundred feet and exhibiting the same cleavage and jagged precipices that distinguish Ausable Chasm, on the opposite side of the lake.
At the town of Winooski, the river flows over a dam two hundred feet wide and twenty-five feet high, but before the dam was constructed,
to afford power for several mills, the river here was a long stretch of cascades and cataracts, a condition which is still continued below the
falls and to its place of outlet. From Essex Junction the Vermont Central follows the Winooski to Montpelier, passing the beautiful town
of Waterbury, which is the pass of Green Mountains and the center of some of the
finest scenery in the State. From Waterbury it is only ten miles by stage to Mount
Mansfield, which is the loftiest peak in the range (4,389 feet), and from the summit
of which a splendid view is had of lovely valleys, gushing streams and battalions of
graceful mountains. In this same vicinity, checkered by many mountain streams,
are Peacock Falls, Bingham Falls, Moss-Glen Falls, Morrisville Falls, and others of
lesser note but
equal beauty.
At the base of
Mansfield Peak
is a stage station,
called
Stowe, from
which the
crown of the
mountain is
plainly observable,
exhibiting
the distinct
features of a
giant, whose
forehead, nose
and chin are
formed by two
rents in the
summit, making
the proportions,
as well as the outlines, so perfect that visitors are quick to discover the likeness even before a guide calls attention to it. Camel’s
Hump is another mountain, five miles from Waterbury, the second highest in the range (4,000 feet), but its surface is so broken that no
wagon-road has as yet been made to the summit, but a horse may be ridden to the top, and the ascent, accomplished at whatever expense
of effort, is well repaid by the magnitude and magnificence of the scenery thus brought into view. Balton Falls are within five miles of
the Hump, and are a shrine of beauty to which hundreds of summer visitors pay the tribute of admiration.</p>

<p>WINOOSKI RIVER, NEAR MIDDLESEX, VERMONT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From Montpelier the Vermont Central turns south, following a tributary of the Winooski to Roxbury, thence it strikes the valley of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>White River, down which it continues to the Connecticut River; but this latter region is more subdued than the section just described.
The scenery, while not so grand and mountainous, possesses a beauty to excite the fancy of a poet and day-dreamer, for the views are of
gentle meandering streams roaming through woods where fairies might love to dwell, singing their lonesome lullabies to the deep coverts that
bend low along the shores. Dainty waterfalls, murmuring rapids, sylvan shades, distinguish the way of many brooks that roll out of mountain
springs and run down to the sea, giving drink to the farmers’ herds, trundling old water-mills, and doing many kind offices on the way.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another branch of the Vermont
Central runs due south
from Essex Junction and Burlington,
on the shore of Lake
Champlain, and passes through
many thriving villages, such as
New Haven, Middlebury, Brandon
and Rutland. At this
latter point, which is on a
considerable stream called Otter
Creek, some very charming
scenery occurs, not entirely confined
to the creek, which, however,
is a stream almost as
remarkable as the Winooski.
At a place called Clarendon
Gorge the creek flows through
a chasm some thirty feet deep
and so narrow that when the
foliage of the banks is heaviest
the stream is almost entirely
hidden by the overlacing
branches of opposite trees.
Here the stream makes a sharp
turn, and in doing so has cut
deeply into the rock-shore
against which it strikes, and
formed a deep pool in which
fish fairly swarm, and hence at
all seasons the angler here may
find the choicest sport. The Green Mountain Range is within five miles of Rutland, and several outlying peaks are much nearer, such as
Paco, Killington, Shrewsbury and Bald Peaks, which are of sufficient altitude to give the summit-observer a good view of Lake George
and the Adirondacks. The road continues southwest from Rutland through a pass in the Green Mountains at Healdville and joins the more
eastern section at Bellows Falls, on the Connecticut River.</p>

<p>A RURAL SCENE IN VERMONT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>At Montpelier our photographer proceeded due east over the Montpelier and Wells River Railroad to Woodsville, a route which follows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>a third confluent of the Winooski for some miles to Marshfield station, where it makes an elbow-turn southwest by Peabody’s Lake, and
thence keeps close to the bank of Wells River, a small stream that discharges into the Connecticut at Woodsville. The region thus
traversed is somewhat broken, but is highly cultivated; and the farm scenes along the way are particularly charming. Agriculture in the
Eastern States exhibits a striking contrast with that in the West, and in Vermont and New Hampshire the dissimilarity of method and the
size of farm is especially great. The soil down east, in the sections named, has to be reclaimed, not from the forests so much as from the
rocks, for it is essentially a
rocky country. The fences
are usually made of stumps and
stones, material which is plentifully
at hand, so that the barb-wire
trust has no grip upon
New England agriculturists.
The farms, too, are what Westerners
would call “small acre-patches,”
but they are so industriously
and intelligently
tilled that every foot of ground
is made to yield its full capacity.
Frugal, yet hospitable—poor,
maybe, yet refined—the
down-east farmer is a hard
worker, a lover of books, patient,
contented, and, withal, a
generous man, philosophic and
industrious enough to extract
happiness out of harsh natural
conditions.</p>

<p>FALLS OF THE AMMOONOOSUC, IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Woodsville is at the junction
of the Ammoonoosuc with
the Connecticut River, along
the valley of which former
stream the railroad runs until
it strikes the White Mountains,
into which region of world-famous
scenery our artist journeyed.
A branch of the road extends south to a terminus at Profile House, which is at the base of Profile Mountain, in the Franconia
Range. This peak, which is 4,000 feet above the sea, possesses two remarkable features that have served to make it known throughout
the world. At the crown there are several colossal stones, so distributed by chance that when viewed from Profile Mountain House they
resemble a mounted cannon, on which account the peak is often called Mount Cannon. But a greater natural curiosity occurs to visitors
after 1,200 feet of the ascent is made, for suddenly there appears the bold and exceedingly well-defined features of “The Old Man of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>Mountains,” formed by three masses of rock so disposed that its ninety feet of face exhibits the clean-cut characteristics of forehead, nose,
lips and chin perfectly outlined against the sky. A few feet below the point of observation, where the old man’s face is exposed, the stone
giant changes his features like a magician and becomes “a toothless old woman in a mop-cap.” Hawthorne has used this wonderful image
to excellent effect in his “Twice-Told Tales,” in which the Great Stone Face is made the subject of a weird theme. Still nearer the base
of the mountain is an exquisite lakelet known as the “Old Man’s Wash-bowl,” just large enough for the purpose, but full of fish, and from
the shore of which a splendid
view of Eagle Cliff may be had.
In the immediate neighborhood
is the lofty peak of Mount Lafayette,
5,269 feet above the
sea, from whose wind-swept
head a landscape of marvelous
diversity and beauty may be
surveyed, including miles of
the Green Mountain Range and
the entire aggregation of White
Mountain peaks.</p>

<p>THE FLUME, NEAR PROFILE HOUSE, FRANCONIA MOUNTAINS.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Less than one mile from
Profile House, and reached by
a perfect carriage-road, is Franconia’s
chiefest marvel, known
as the Flume. Six hundred feet
of cascades go churning their
way through a fissure whose
vertical walls are sixty feet high
and less than twenty feet apart.
In this chasm is the Flume,
along the narrow confines of
which a plank-walk has been
built to permit visitors to observe
more closely the wonders
that nature has planted along
this mountain brook. One mile
south are the Georgianna Falls,
the largest yet discovered in
the mountainous districts of the State, plunging in successive leaps over two precipices, each eighty feet in height, and scattering their
spray into vapor that keeps the vicinity drenched. Other mountain or detached peaks near-by are Lincoln, Liberty, Flume, and Big
Coolidge; while further towards the east, yet in sight, are North, and South, Twin, Lowell, Carrigan and Huntington, from any of which
magnificent views are obtainable.</p>

<p>CRAWFORD HOUSE NOTCH, NEW HAMPSHIRE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Turning back north from Profile House, our artist proceeded west from Bethlehem Junction over the Maine Central Railway, and
after a short ride reached Fabyan’s, where the scenery of the White Mountains broke upon his enraptured vision in all its glory. Two miles
below is Crawford’s Notch, the natural pass into the range, and here the visitor has his surprise as well as admiration quickened by a sight
of the “Elephant’s Head.” Standing on the piazza of a hotel at Crawford’s, the enormous head and trunk seem to be just emerging from
the deep woods near the entrance to the pass, and the gray of the granite slope serves to strengthen the illusion. From the Elephant’s Head
Hotel there is a particularly fine
view of the Notch, a gigantic
cleft through which the Titans
may have forced a way, but
which is now utilized by the
railroad. It is from this point
that excursions to the summit of
Mount Washington, by way of
the bridle-path opened by Thos.
J. Crawford in 1840, are made.
A great majority of persons prefer
the easier ascent by means
of the cog-wheel railroad, which
was completed in 1869, and requires
one and one-half hours
to make the trip, the fare being
$6.00. The summit of Mount
Washington is 6,293 feet above
sea level; and as the rail distance
is three miles, the grade is very
great, in one place being a rise
of one foot in three, or 33 per
cent. To secure perfect safety
the track is composed of three
rails bolted to a trestle of heavy
timbers, the center rail being
an immense wrought-iron
ladder, with rounds four inches
apart, into which the cogs of
the locomotive drive-wheels fit,
and thus drag the train up the
steep, as well as control it in
making the descent, though
automatic air-brakes are used in emergencies. But though the rail route, in swinging seats, is more comfortable and expeditious, if time
be any consideration, the carriage-road is almost as popular with travelers, who, as a rule, are willing to make sacrifices, if by so doing
they obtain the recompense of grander sights. As our artist had made the ascent of Pike’s Peak by car, he concluded to take in the larger
experience of gaining the summit of Mount Washington by stage, that he might be better able to report the contrast. Though the distance
by rail is only three miles, by wagon-road it is ten, so winding is the way, and to add to the distress of the latter journey, the first four
miles is toilsome without revealing any scenery worth the effort of a glance. But above the four-mile point the dreary, tame and desolate
aspect is succeeded by a landscape that cannot be excelled for magnificence. It is here that the creaking stage emerges from the woods
that hides the prospect and moves out upon the bare crags, and the Ledge House, or Half-Way Station, is reached, where a stop is made to
rest the horses and give passengers opportunity and time to drink in the glories of the wondrous view that is thus presented. Far down
below yawns the measureless void of a tremendous gulf, while above is a colossal pile of granite that supports the dome of Washington and
a wide-spreading wilderness of
tumult. Looking off in the distance
from this natural observatory,
the presidential peaks of
Mounts Adams, Jefferson and
Madison are plainly visible,
whose aged sides are cloven
by deep crevasses and their
feet are hidden in gorges of
tremendous depths; while
a glance downward over the
ragged tops of the forest trees
discovers Peabody Glen and
river, with a white spot in the
fading distance that by aid of
glass is found to be the Crawford
House. Following the
vale out to its entrance upon
the Androscoggin Meadows, the
vision sweeps up Mount Moriah,
and traversing the Confederate
Peaks to the summit of Mount
Carter, finally rests upon the
brow of Washington, which is
almost overhead.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the Ledge the road
continues its zigzag way up the steep and around dangerously narrow terraces, over which a party of excursionists in a six-horse wagon
tumbled to their death on the 3d of July, 1880, the only accident that has ever occurred in making the remarkable descent here, however
perilous appears the passage; and this tragedy was due to a drunken driver. In describing the ascent above Midway House, Mr. Drake
thus writes: “A sharp turn around a ledge, and the southeast wall of Tuckerman’s Ravine rose up like a wraith out of the forest.
Nearer at hand was the Head of Huntington’s, while to the right the cone of Washington loomed up gradually, more than a thousand feet
higher. A little to left you look down into the gloomy depths of Pinkham defile, the valley of Ellis River and the Saco Valley to North
Conway. The blue course of the Ellis, which is nothing but a long cascade, the rich green of the Conway intervales, the blanched peak of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>Chocurua, the sapphire summits of Ossipee Mountains were presented in conjunction with the black and humid walls of the ravine, and the
iron-gray moss of the great dome. The crag on which I stood leans out over the mountain like a bastion, from which the spectator sees the
deep-entrenched valleys, the rivers which wash the feet of the monarch, and the long line of summits which partake of his grandeur while
making it all the more impressive. From here the striking spectacle of four great northern peaks, their naked summits, their sides seamed
with old and new slides, and flecked with snow, constantly enlarged. There were some terrible rents in the side of Clay, red as half-closed
wounds, and in one place the
mountain seemed riven to its
center. It was this gulf that
the first climber said it was such
a precipice he could scarce discern
the bottom. The rifts in
the walls of the ravine, the
blasted fir-trees leaning over
the abyss, and clutching the
rocks with a death-grip, the
rocks themselves, tormented,
formidable, impending, astounded
by their vivid portrayal
of the formless, their suggestions
of the agony in which
these mountains were brought
forth.”</p>

the chaotic landscape which
spreads out before the startled

mountain breast, what must be
the sensation inspired by the
tremendous view that is afforded
from the summit? It is the
feeling of complete separation
from the earth, of suspension
in the sky and looking down
upon the world below. The
exhilaration that comes from
conquering a mighty thing; the solemnity of being face to face with infinity. But gradually an orderly array of magnificence and comprehensible
grandeur appears, as peak upon peak is resolved into definable chains, clusters, or detached masses. Hills draw apart, valleys
open, streams and cascades sparkle in their tortuous beds, while the skirts of the mountains are dotted with rich colors and the meadow-lands
become a fringe of emerald encompassing their irregular bases. Almost independent of the will, the eye wanders from summit to
summit, making a slow circuit of the crenated horizon, until it is arrested by a vast spread of gleaming white that at first sight may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>mistaken for a luminous cloud in the southeast. More careful observation reveals that it is the ocean, one hundred miles away, and by the
help of telescope vessels may be distinguished, and even the number of sails which each craft carries.</p>

either extent or grandeur, with that obtained from the summit of Pike’s Peak. Not so great in altitude as its nobler rival of the Rockies,
it is wanting in other conditions
to make it equal, chief of which
is the usually heavy and hazy
atmosphere that is due to proximity
to the sea, thus interfering
with the range of vision, and
more frequently interposing

<p class='c011'>From Mount Washington,
the tourist who delights to revel among the wonderful scenes of this tumultuary and anarchistic region, where nature is in disarrangement
through the operation of forces that long since have spent themselves, usually proceeds west by Thorn Hill, through Carter Notch, and thus
arrives at the village of Jackson, the center of another district of great scenic interest. The town is but a handful of pretty white cottages,
but it is in the quiet isolation of a mountain-engirdled vale, and the very lonesomeness of its situation gives the place an inexpressible
fascination, for it is like meeting cheerful company in the valley of desolation. The largest house, commanding respect by reason of its
size, and exciting reverence for its holy purposes, is a frame church, in whose belfry the pigeons swarm, undisturbed by the deep tones of
the bell that summons the hamlet to worship. How mournfully it peals out the first stroke, as if awakening the town from sleep, so still is
the place; but from a toll it becomes a chime, as the notes reverberate from hill to hill, until the noise is reassuring, that however lifeless
things may have seemed, the church-bell has power to stir the people into mental if not physical activity. All about are mountains, Eagle,
Wild-Cat, Tin, Iron and Thorn,

<p class='c011'>Wild-Cat River cuts the
town of Jackson in twain, a
stream which is in fact a mountain
cataract, filling the air about
with its incessant roar. Within
less than two hundred yards
of the place the river makes
a swift descent over granite
ledges, which it has washed to
almost whiteness, and near the
bridge it is divided by a large
bowlder into two cascades that
are half-concealed by the rich
foliage that bends down to receive
the refreshing spray. The
crest of the falls is split by huge
stones and the main stream has
overcome the obstacles in its
way by cutting a passage under
the rocks, after which it shoots
down the ledge and becomes a
faithful servant to a miller, who
has utilized its power. Besides these cataracts there are several others, principal among which is Goodrich Falls, at which point the river
pours its restless flood over a precipice eighty feet high. Bridal Veil Cascades are a mile further up the river, but there is a pleasant bridle-path
all the way, and visitors to this district rarely fail to pay their respects to this very interesting part of the stream. The bed of the river
is full of enormous bowlders, and its flow takes, accordingly, an erratic course; in fact, in every direction save upward. At the cascades
the stream is parted by an elevation in the center of the ledge, and thus falls in a double sheet at almost right angles, where, gathering new
force again, it goes rushing away to join the Androscoggin, which bears its waters to the sea. A tour of the mountains having been completed,
our photographer doubled upon his tracks and returned to the Profile House, from which road-terminus he crossed the twelve-mile
interval to North Woodstock, and there took train on the Concord and Montreal Railroad for points of attraction towards the southwest.
The mountain region, however, was not yet entirely passed, for many prominent elevations, such as Mounts Moosilauke, Tecumseh,
Tri-pyramid, Welch, Fisher, Stinson, Irael, and others, continued in view until Ashland was reached, at which place a stop was made to
visit Squam Lake, one of the most exquisite sheets of water in the world. It is irregular in shape, but about six miles long by half as many
broad. The expanse is not great, but the beauties which it presents are charming in the extreme. Over its bosom are scattered numerous
islands which are very bowers of beauty, green with thickets of hazel and margined with mosaics of wild flowers. The waters are of such
limpid purity that they swarm with fish, which may be seen frisking and playing tag twenty feet below the surface. The shores are banked
but level, and along the edge is a perfect carriage-road, making a
circuit of twenty-one miles, affording the finest excursion that can be
made by vehicle. Squam Lake is separated from Lake Winnipiseogee
by a strip of land two
miles wide, and the
village of Center Harbor
lies on the west
shore of the latter,
where steamer may be
taken for a ride to
Wolfborough, twelve
miles distant. The
trip is a delightful one
through narrow channels
between islands of
exceeding beauty, so
thickly strewed over
the water as to make
the way appear like a
labyrinth. Six miles
northwest of the lake
is an eminence over
two thousand feet
high, known as Red Hill, which is annually visited by many hundreds of tourists. There is a good carriage-road to the base, but the
ascent is so steep and rugged that by foot or horse-back is the only means for gaining the summit. Though not nearly so lofty as a
score or more of the mountains we have mentioned, yet visitors maintain that the view afforded from its peak exceeds in extent and magnificence
that obtained from the observatory of Mount Washington or the summits of any of its brothers. This superiority is due to the
absence of intervening peaks, as Red Hill is isolated, and overlooks a comparatively level district, in which Squam and Winnipiseogee

<p>BRIDAL VEIL CASCADE, WHITE MOUNTAINS.—<span class="multicaption">Wild Cat River, inaptly named in the pioneer times of New England, is an enchanting stream for the tourist and the painter. Its course is broken by many ravishingly beautiful waterfalls and cascades, each presenting new and charming features. At Bridal Veil Cascade the bed of the river is full of immense boulders, upon which the descending stream is broken into a thousand forms of diversified loveliness. At the summit the stream is parted by an elevation in the centre of the ledge, and thus falls in a double sheet at almost right angles, greatly enhancing the charming features of the delightful scene.</span></p>

<p>THE OLD TOWER AT NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From Wolfborough the route was east by the Maine Central Railroad to Portland, and thence by steamer to Boston. There are many
beautiful places in the vicinity of Portland, and particularly about the popular summer resorts of Mount Desert Island and Bar Harbor; but
much must be sacrificed to the limit of space,
for no one book can ever contain pictures of
all the natural scenery that is worthy to be
reproduced. Among other photographs
taken in and about Portland, we have room
for only one, viz.: the light-house on Cape
Elizabeth, in the harbor, a dreary desolation
of stone, where the ocean is treacherous and a
warning to incoming vessels is indispensable.</p>

<p class='c011'>Boston is historic ground, around which
are many sacred spots perpetuated in patriotic
memories. It is a great city; but the
traveled visitor is indifferent to municipal
sights, and is restless to pay his tribute of
respect and curiosity to those shrines that
keep in mind the reverent character of the
Puritan, and the heroism of the Revolutionary
soldier. It is hard to resist this infectious
temptation to photograph monuments and
battle-fields, when one is walking upon the
very famous dust, and reading inscriptions
recording the valor of those who fought for
our National Independence; but this is a
volume devoted to American scenery rather
than to American history, a subject which
ought to inspire equal patriotic sentiment,
and monumental tributes must therefore be
omitted, or casually mentioned by incidental
reference, as may appear proper.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Boston our artist proceeded by a
train on the Old Colony Railroad to Cohasset,
a town which it has been truthfully said
marks one of the most interesting, most
wildly beautiful bits of nature on any coast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This town,” let it be said, “marks
one of the most interesting, most wildly
beautiful bits of nature on any known coast.
In this situation are to be found all the
beauties and all the terrors which ocean
scenes can compass. The history of Cohasset,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>for the past two hundred and fifty years, has in it an element personal to every civilized people on the globe, since all have sent their ships
and their travelers this way, and added names to the death-roll hereabouts. The crags and ledges along these shores have taken part in
ocean tragedies for generations, and have witnessed more of human suffering and the extremity of distress than often falls to the lot of natural
scenes. Upon their faces the ocean surges have never ceased to dash themselves since the morning of creation. Here the whiteness never
goes out of the line of surf; and often the conditions are of shattered waters flying in the air, of roaring breakers crashing into fragments
along the rocks, of great masses
of billows lashed into fury, and
resistless in their commonest
attacks by all except the natural
barriers to their progress here
set up.”</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE CLIFFS AT NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Beautiful, commanding,
stirring as the scenes are about
Cohasset’s bounding shores, yet
the tragedies which have
occurred in the treacherous
approaches to the harbor are both
numerous and heart-appalling.
On these very rocks, where the
waters usually play in such happy
abandon, more than seven score
of persons from a single ship—the
<i>St. John</i>, in October, 1849—were
dashed to their deaths, and
disasters attended by less mortality
became so common that
the Government erected a lighthouse
at Minot’s Ledge, which
is two miles off Cohasset Point,
where the hidden rocks are most
dangerous to shipping.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Cohasset the trip was
south, by the Old Colony, along
the Atlantic shore, passing
many points of great interest,
though for scenery there is nothing but marshes and a waste of sandy beach. But on the way, Daniel Webster’s farm is pointed out, located
on a level strip between the railroad and Marshfield Neck, where it would appear that raising clams might be more profitably pursued than
the growing of grain or vegetable. Quaint scenes, reminders of the olden times when stage-coaching was the most luxurious mode of travel,
and pot-hooks and hangers were adjuncts of the crane that rendered the fire-place the sole convenience for cooking, pass in review and are
a source of the greatest interest to those of a retrospective and reflective turn of mind. Here and there we observe old Puritan churches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>and equally old-fashioned people, whose appearances
indicate that they have not been widely
distributed since the Mayflower landed. There
is a Miles Standish, John Alden and Priscilla in
every village, and the houses, in many cases,
tell of a time quite as remote. Indeed, in the
little but ancient hamlet of Greenbush, which is
within a half-dozen miles of Cohasset, and
twice as far to Nantasket, an intensely fashionable
resort, one may see the identical old oaken
bucket and the crazy sweep by which “dripping
with coolness it rose from the well,” which inspired
Woodworth’s immortal lay in 1817.
There, too, is the same old house, hiding behind
a clump of trees, under which the poet sat and
drank from the “full blushing goblet,” which,
alas for human weakness, he really coveted less
than a beaker of good wine.</p>

<p>PURGATORY CHASM, NEAR NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Twenty-five miles south of Cohasset is the
historic town of Plymouth, and right in front of
it is a harbor made by a long neck of land,
parallel with the shore, and known as the Cow-Yard,
in which the Mayflower came to anchor
with her precious cargo of forefathers, on a bleak
December day in 1620. Mr. Samuel Adams
Drake has written:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Plymouth is the American Mecca. It
does not contain the tomb of the prophet, but
the rock of the forefathers, their traditions and
their graves. The first impressions of a stranger
are disappointing, for the oldest town in New
England looks as fresh as if built within the
century. There is not much that is suggestive
of the old life to be seen there. Except the
hills, the heaven, and the sea, there is nothing
antique; save a few carefully cherished relics,
nothing that has survived the day of the Pilgrims.”
And another writer of recent times
declares “it would be difficult to name any
other place in America with such a profoundly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>interesting historical event as that which has made the name of Plymouth Rock forever famous in the annals of devotion and freedom.
Upwards of fifty thousand persons come here every summer, making reverent pilgrimages to the cradle of American civilization. For
these, and for all who love the antique and historic, Plymouth has well-nigh unrivaled attractions. Here is the renowned rock, down by
the water-side, overarched by a stately granite canopy, in whose top are the bones of several of the Pilgrims. Up in the village rises the
massive structure of Pilgrim Hall, consecrated to relics and memorials of the first colonists. Near this shrine is the court-house, with rare
records and documents of the seventeenth century. On a noble hill rises the Pilgrim National Monument, a vast pile of carved granite
crowned by a very impressive
statue of Faith, forty feet high,
and the largest stone figure in
the world.</p>

<p>NEGRO-HEAD CLIFFS, NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Burial Hill is one of the
most interesting localities in
New England. On every side
are the tombs and monuments
of the founders of the State and
their descendants. Above these
sacred graves the pleased eye
wanders over an exquisite panorama
of sea and shore, lonely
islands, far-reaching promontories,
and distant blue hills, out
across the blue sea to where the
sandy strand of Cape Cod bounds
the view, low down on the horizon.
On this bleak summit
stood the fortified log-church
and watch-tower, the former
bearing six three-pound cannon
on its flat roof, and the latter
occupied by vigilant sentinels.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is about forty miles from
Plymouth to Newport, Rhode
Island, one of the ultra-fashionable
summer seaside resorts,
and thither our artist repaired
to take views of that vicinity. Newport is not only famous for its fine bathing beach, elegant villas, and its harbor specially adapted for
yacht-racing; there is much more to recommend the city to visitors than these means of recreation and pleasant vanities. Commercially,
Newport is a metropolis of looms; historically, it is a city of great consequence; and scenically, a place of extraordinary interest.
The Old Tower at Newport has been for centuries an object of curious inquiry and patient investigation. For many years the opinion
obtained generally that it was a relic of the Norsemen’s discovery and occupation of the country, five hundred years before the time of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>Columbus, and that in some way the building was connected with Druidic worship. The Druids of England and France performed their
religious ceremonies under oak trees and always in the open air, but this fact did not affect the belief current for so long a time that the
Stone Tower was the remains
of either an edifice or a monument
erected by the Druids.
When this opinion finally
changed to the more reasonable
though equally false one that
the tower was the relic of a fort
built by Norsemen sea-kings
about the year 985, historians
appeared to be satisfied and inquiry
ceased for a long while.
Finally, investigation of the
Runic inscriptions on the Dighton
Rock, in Massachusetts,
revived curiosity in the tower,
and the result of the last investigation
is the opinion that it is
the ruins of a wind-mill that
was built some time in the seventeenth
century. The truth,
however, may as well be told,
that notwithstanding what historians
say to the contrary, no
one knows, or is likely ever to
know, when, by whom, or for
what purpose the so-called tower
was built. It is a question about
which there can be nothing but
speculation.</p>

<p>SOLDIERS’ MONUMENT ON EAST ROCK, NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Newport is located on a
peninsula on the east shore of
Narragansett Bay, which is a
splendid harbor, having an
anchorage of thirty feet in low
water. The scenery about the
place, too, is very fine, and is
brought into advantageous view by a charming drive-way that extends along the beach and entirely around the city. A part of the sea-shore
line is very rocky and precipitous, and the assaults of terrific breakers for many ages have worn these cliffs into wonderful shapes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>Purgatory Chasm is, perhaps, the most remarkable example of wave force in this vicinity, though the agency of water has, no doubt, been
reinforced by some other natural power, such as glacier, earthquake or volcano. Near-by are Hanging Rocks, where Berkeley is said to
have composed his <cite>Minute Philosophy</cite>; and less than three hundred yards distant is Spouting Cave, where the surf dashes into a grotto and
thence through a hole in the roof to a height at times of fifty feet, affording a beautiful spectacle. Other points of interest along the cliffs
are individualized by such names as Eastman’s, Green’s End, Lime Rock, Negro-Head Cliffs, the Flints, the Dumplings, Cockle-Shell
Ledge, etc. After a brief circuit of Newport’s attractions, our artist departed for Western Connecticut and thence to Albany, there to take
boat down the Hudson for New
York City. The route lay
through New Haven, where a
short stop was made to take a
picture of East Rock and the
Soldiers’ Monument thereon.
East Rock is a bluff 360 feet
high, on the north side of the
city, to which a beautiful
carriage-road leads, and from
its summit a wide extent of
charming landscape is presented,
taking in a part of the
Connecticut Valley towards the
west, Yale College on the east,
and spanning Long Island
Sound on the south, so that
when the weather is clear the
low banks of Long Island may
be distinguished.</p>

<p>BALANCED ROCK, NEAR PITTSFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From New Haven the route
was north and west over the
Housatonic system to Pittsfield,
Massachusetts, in the Berkshire
region, a city of some 17,000
people, and noted for its many
interesting buildings of national
reputation, as well as for the
lovely scenery that environs it. The place is elegantly situated on a high plateau, with the Taconic Mountains on the west and the
Hoosac Range commanding the eastern view. It will be remembered by students of history that Fighting Parson Allen, of Revolutionary
fame, was pastor of the First Methodist Church in Pittsfield, and they will be gratified to know that the building is still standing and that
it exhibits little impairment from age. The Agassiz Association, with an enrolled membership of 20,000, has its headquarters in the city,
and the place is also the seat of many prominent historical and educational institutions. But it is the scenery thereabout that interests us
most. Waconah Falls is a pretty cascade ten miles from the city, and still nearer is Roaring Brook, that rushes down the side of a mountain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>in torrential flow, through a gap known as Tories’ Cave, and contributes its waters to Ashley Pond, whence the city’s supply is obtained.
Lake Onota is a picturesque sheet two miles west of Pittsfield, and near-by is Balanced Rock, one of the greatest natural curiosities in
America. It is a tremendous bowlder, as the illustration shows, the estimated weight of which is 480 tons, and is balanced on a point that
is only one foot square. So unstable is its appearance, resting on such a slender foundation, that it looks as if a zephyr might topple it
over, yet so firmly poised that an army of giants could hardly disturb its equilibrium.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>CROSS ROCK, NEAR PITTSFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In a rocky field three miles from the city is another great natural curiosity known as Cross Rock, which has been singularly
cleft, by some unknown agency,
into the form of a perfect cross,
to which a few superstitious people
formerly attributed remarkable
healing virtues, but which
no one any longer regards.</p>

<p class='c011'>Four miles east of Pittsfield
is the village of Dalton, where
immense quantities of paper are
manufactured, and on the Pittsfield
line is located the mill that
produces all the Government
bank-note paper. West Pittsfield,
about five miles from the
city proper, is also an interesting
place, reposing under the
shadows of Taconic Mountains,
and celebrated as being the
national headquarters of what is
known as the “United Society
of Believers in Christ’s Second
Appearing.” This curious sect
of Shakers, disciples of Ann Lee,
founded the village more than a
century ago, and their “Millennial”
church, which was built
soon after, still stands as one of
the most conspicuous buildings
in New England. Massachusetts has been famous as the home of religious denominations possessing peculiar tenets almost since the landing
of the Pilgrims; but from the days of Salem witchcraft to the present, few sects have adopted more curious beliefs and ceremonials than
the Shakers. Yet, to their credit let it be spoken, they are good citizens, honest, generous, faithful, industrious and kindly in all their
intercourse with the world as well as among themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Pittsfield our artist proceeded to New Albany, and thence by boat to New York, where he joined the two other photographers,
the route of the third having been east by way of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which now remains to be described.</p>

The instructions given upon the separation of our three photographers, after leaving St. Louis, were necessarily indefinite, and
discrimination in the selection of routes and views had to be left to individual judgment, since weather and conditions play an
important part in the artists’ profession. Our third photographer departed somewhat from the route which he had selected to
cover, for after the separation, instead of proceeding directly east through Pennsylvania, as was his first intention, he went south
to Cincinnati and east by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, through the lovely Blue Grass region of Kentucky, making his first
stop at Charleston, the capital of West Virginia. The capital is a small place of something less than 7,000 inhabitants, and with
nothing of particular importance to visitors except the mountain scenery which invests it. The Kanawha River, upon which the town is
situated, is navigable for small
crafts from this point to its
junction with the Ohio, but
above Charleston the stream is
treacherous and its channel so
rock-infested that a skiff can
hardly follow the stream without
danger. Thirty miles from the
capital are the Kanawha Falls,
or cataracts, where the river
goes tearing over several
benches of thinly stratified
rocks, and has scooped out a
pool of very great depth, where
fishing is said to be excellent.
On the north side of the river
at this point are the Gauley
Mountains, rising to a considerable
altitude, but so gently
that the slopes have been reclaimed
from thick timber
growths and converted into
beautiful farms.</p>

<p class='c011'>The scenery all through
the valley of the Kanawha is
tumultuously grand, but nine
miles beyond the falls it attains its greatest glory. Here the tremendous cliffs rise vertically to a height of 1,200 feet, and at a point
called “The Hawk’s Nest” a breast of the bluffs extends out over the river in a perilous shelf 1,000 feet high, from which lofty elevation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>the river becomes a ribbon of white, and a
train of cars running along the mountain
skirts on the opposite side looks like a
string of army-ants hurrying to an attack.
The view down the valley is one of ineffable
magnificence, presenting as it does a
double file of noble mountains dressed in
uniforms of lovely green, which, as they
recede, assume a sky-blue hue, and then
gradually fade away in the opalescent mist
of distance.</p>

<p>FALLING SPRING, NEAR WARM SPRINGS, VIRGINIA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Thirty miles above Kanawha Falls, at
a town called Hinton, the New and Green-Brier
Rivers unite to form the Kanawha,
and here the scenery is likewise charmingly
picturesque. The line of lofty bluffs
continues along the south shore of New
River, under which the Chesapeake and
Ohio Railroad runs upon a bare passageway,
while the north line is marked by
graceful mountains that in the distance
look like lines of beauty tracing the horizon.
In some places the ledges are 1,200
feet high, and the river so contracted that
the cañon is almost dark at midday. The
view is further diversified by successive
rapids and cataracts, while at frequent intervals
the bluffs recede, leaving stretches
of fertile valley that are in a high state of
cultivation, with pretty farm houses dotting
the landscape and imparting an appearance
of prosperous animation to these pleasing
interludes. The road follows the valley of
Green-Brier River twenty miles further, to
Caldwell, then passes through White Sulphur
Springs, and a few minutes later
crosses the James River at Clifton Forge,
where that romantic stream, drawing its
inspiration from the Alleghenies, cuts its
way through the Blue Ridge Mountains.</p>

<p>WAITING FOR TIME TO CATCH UP.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Clifton Forge is forty miles east of White Sulphur Springs, and from this junction a branch of the Chesapeake and Ohio Road runs
northeast to form a connection with the Shenandoah Valley Railroad at Waynesborough. All the region hereabout is very rugged, and
intersected by beautiful streams whose sources are springs that break out of the sides of mountains, and the waters are generally more or
less impregnated with sulphur. Eighteen miles due north of Clifton Forge, and reached by a delightful road that winds through charming
vales, is the village of Warm Springs, the capital of Bath county, and adjacent are the Warm Sulphur Springs, which attract so many
visitors in search of health and fine scenery. It is a mountain town, whose population fluctuates with the season, for while the place is
one of some animation from April to October, during the other months there are not enough people in the village to keep the mud-daubers
out of the houses. A more
picturesque district, however,
can scarcely be found; too
mountainous to permit agriculture,
nature has given other
blessings than fertility to the
region. The climate is extremely
invigorating, and the
numerous springs possess medicinal
properties of undoubted
value, while the scenery is inspiring
to even the most
phlegmatic. One of the chief
objects which serves to further
diversify the landscape of high-lifted
peaks, jutting cliffs,
meandering brooks, green coverts,
sylvan solitudes and cloistral
caverns, is Falling Spring,
a sheet of rainbow-flecked water
that dashes over a ledge seventy
feet high, and which, seen from
a little distance, may be likened
in appearance to the white
trailing trousseau of a bride, so
delicate, graceful, and gossamer-like
is its form, so joyous is its
laughter. After leaving Clifton Forge the road winds along the sinuous valley of James River, with charming views on both sides, until
interest, charm and excitement are superseded by wonder as Natural Bridge, that marvelous curiosity of ages, is reached, and preparation is
immediately made to examine and to photograph its astounding formation and immensity. This great natural wonder, which is an old
acquaintance to all school-children, is two miles from the railway station, at the termination of a very deep gorge, through which flows a
capricious little stream called Cedar Creek. At one time this feeble brook may have been a raging river, and needed bridging, but like an
old man, it has lost the vigor of former days and fallen into the seventh age of decrepitude. But the bridge which Titans might have
constructed still spans the creek’s deep bed and has grown in mightiness as the waters below subsided. To speak with mathematical
exactness, without employing statistical details, it may be said that the Natural Bridge spans with graceful and architectural proportions
the perpendicular ledges of Cedar Creek, which rise 200 feet above the stream. The center of its wondrous arch is forty feet in perpendicular
thickness and sixty feet wide, while the span is exactly eighty-nine feet. A public highway utilizes the bridge, and it is the only
means of passage for wagons within a mile either way, except by a steep bank, very difficult to ascend, a short distance below the gorge.
Just above the bridge the creek bluffs are broken into masses that look like immense buttresses, pinnacled at places and reaching to a height
of 250 feet. The most imposing
view is obtained from a
position fifty yards below the
bridge, where the arch appears
both lighter and higher, and
the walls more dangerously
precipitous. From this point
of view this world-famous natural
structure appears as perfect
as if cut by design; a colossal
arch that shines in the sun like
variegated marble, without
stratification or displacement,
so high that the largest sailing
vessel might pass under without
touching the peak of her
mainmast. On the abutments
of the bridge are carved the
names of many adventurous
youths who sought fame by
leaving a record of their reckless
efforts to scale the dizzy
heights of stone. George Washington
was not above this ambition
to win reputation by
carving his name higher up
than any of his fellow-youths,
and for nearly seventy years he
held the honor of being the most intrepid and expert wall-climber, for, like Ben Adam, his name led all the rest. But in 1818 this distinction
was surrendered to James Piper, of Washington College, who performed the daring, and what was long thought to be impossible, feat of
climbing from the foot of the abutment to the top of the arch, an exploit so dangerous that no one has since made a mad attempt to repeat
it. Thomas Jefferson was moved to write a eulogium of this incomparable natural wonder in this wise:</p>

<p>FALLS OF NEW RIVER, NEAR HINTON, WEST VIRGINIA.—<span class="multicaption">Thirty miles above Kanawha Falls, the New and Greenbrier Rivers unite to form the Kanawha, and here the scenery is peculiarly grand and picturesque. In some places the ledges soar to a height of 1200 feet, and the river is so narrow that the intervening cañon sees but little of the sunlight except near midday. At some points the bluffs recede, giving space for beautiful green valleys, dotted with pretty farm-houses that lend an appearance of prosperous animation to these pleasing preludes. The river is broken into many rapids, cataracts and falls, which enhance the charms of the scenery by the music of their babbling waters.</span></p>

<p>PASSAGE OF THE FRENCH BROAD RIVER THROUGH THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From Natural Bridge our photographer took train on the Norfolk and Western Railroad, and proceeded southwestwardly to the
junction of that road with the Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad, by which he passed into Tennessee as far as Knoxville, and from
that point made excursions into the famous East Tennessee region, where scenes and scenery are quite unlike anything which he had ever
before transferred to photographs. Nowhere in all the world are there richer lands, prettier women, braver men, finer landscapes, and bigger
prospects than Tennessee affords. It is a region of boundless resources and charming views, and possessing as it does so many advantages,
it likewise presents remarkable
contrasts and conditions. Where
can the scenery about Cumberland
Gap be equaled, or the
panorama from the summit of
Lookout Mountain be matched?
But there is relaxation in the
quiet views of rural life in East
Tennessee which are here reproduced,
and the pastime
reader as well as the student of
geography, will appreciate the
restful change.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tennessee is the neutral
ground between North and
South, because it does not distinctively
belong to either, but
its contiguity to both gives to the
State some of the characteristics
of each. Adopting slavery, it
is Southern, but developing a
strong pro-Union sentiment in
the beginning of the civil war,
Tennessee became Northern
in her affinities; but the slave-marks
of one hundred years have not been effaced even after thirty years of freedom, for in the country and villages there are old slave-cabins,
rickety, but still habitable, the homes of white-haired relics of ante-war times, and the new generation that has not been taught to
tie up their hair with cotton strings. All over the South it is the same; but in East Tennessee there is something else to bring back
old memories, for here the brazen front of war marched through the land, and turned its fair acres of waving grain and fruitful orchards
into battle-fields, furrowed with dead and harrowed with destruction. And yet Tennessee was pro-Union, with secession tendencies, because
her interests were indissolubly linked with the South. But the wounds have all healed; the impetuous youth who went forth to battle is
now a peace-loving grandfather; his daughter was captured by a Yankee, and she has never regretted it, and the railroad runs every day
between the two sections with mail-bags full of peace-messages. Why, the war has been over so long that we get mixed in our history,
and sometimes we are not quite clear whether it was in 1776 or 1861. In fact, many of the old farm houses along the way look decidedly
Revolutionary, and none of the mountains have changed or added another wrinkle to their imperturbable faces.</p>

<p>PASSAGE OF THE JAMES RIVER THROUGH THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS.—<span class="multicaption">The very name of Blue Ridge is music in the ears of many thousands of good and worthy citizens of our country, whose ancestral homes were, or still are, in the midst or within view of the hazy-blue summits of these historic mountains. Any one who has seen them at a distance, in the soft light of an Indian summer, will appreciate the aptitude of the title, and the affection which must be engendered by association with such delightful scenery from childhood to the evening of life. The view presented in the photograph on this page is an exceptionally fine one, showing the mountains on either side and in the distance through the rift made by the river.</span></p>

<p>A SCENE OF RURAL LIFE IN NORTH CAROLINA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In some of the towns there is a lazy air that barely stirs the little wind-mills on the marten-boxes, and indolence and shiftlessness
have their votaries even here. Up in the mountains there are shadows of hard times, which are projected into the valleys and villages in
the form of bull-teams and crotchety “mover-wagons.” The driver has a <i>sang-froid</i> appearance, and as if he was ahead of his expectations,
and is willing to wait for tardy time to catch up. His team is glad to encourage the waiting ambition, and lies down in the street to
keep him patient company.</p>

<p class='c011'>To exhibit the diversity of
scenes in East Tennessee and
the resourceful expedients of the
people, photograph was made of
another mountaineer’s team,
wherein the traction energy of
a bull is compared with that of
a horse, to the humiliation, no
doubt, of the latter. In order to
throw a little more animation
into the scene, our photographer
grouped a party of natives about
the team, so that two purposes
might be served with one stone,
and no mistake might be made
as to types of the people and
their conveyances.</p>

<p class='c011'>On a trip to the north
boundary of the State several
lovely landscape pictures were
secured, one of the most exquisite
being a view in the vicinity
of Galbraith Springs, where
the headwaters of Tennessee
River pour through Short
Mountains, which are the outposts of Cumberland Range, and go careening and pirouetting in many cascades between that point and Knoxville.
The scenery hereabout presents the majesty of imperious isolation, the lonely grandeur of undisputed lordliness; and under the
shadows which these towering mountains cast, are people that live in a little world of their own, almost forgetful that the earth projects
beyond the horizon of their vision. But in this valley of delight the flowers run riot over the hills, the woods and fields are musical with
songs of many birds, and there are the sweets of peace and the bloom of plenty beneath these opalescent skies.</p>

<p>PICTURED BLUFFS ON NEW RIVER, WEST VIRGINIA.—<span class="multicaption">These bluffs derive their name from their close resemblance to the Pictured Rocks of Lake Superior, and there is a very striking similarity between the general appearance and characteristics of the two localities, as all who are familiar with these famous scenic regions will admit. New River has its source in the picturesque Blue Ridge Mountains, flowing thence northwesterly to its junction with the Kanawha, and embracing in its course a wide diversity of some of the grandest and most beautiful scenery in the world.</span></p>

<p>THE OLD MAN’S FACE, NEAR ASHEVILLE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From the pleasant vales about Galbraith the route was south to Morristown, and thence southeast along the valley of the French
Broad River, through Unaka Pass of the Great Smoky Mountains, to North Carolina. Many writers have exhausted the dictionary of
adjectives in describing the romantic beauties of the French Broad, but the stream, and its intervales, bedighted with marvelous cliffs,
continues as nature made it, beyond the power of description. The course of this lovely stream cuts through the charming hills about
Asheville and pours its crystal waters through a narrow gorge until it passes the blockade of the Smoky Mountains. In this space of forty
miles the French Broad is indeed a “racing river,” to which the Cherokees applied the name <i>Tahkecostee</i>, which has that significance, for
it is impetuous, torrential, terrific. From a gentle stream above Asheville, by the contraction of its banks below, the river becomes angry,
and the roar of cataract as it rushes over opposing bowlders fills the air with noise like thunder. At Stack House the current dashes over
a fall twenty feet high, and at Mountain Island it makes another leap and then becomes a noisy rapid to a point known as “Deep Water.”
Here the mountains close in upon the river, forcing it through a narrow channel only one hundred and fifty feet wide and forty feet deep.
The railroad to reach the opposite bank, crosses the river diagonally
by an iron bridge, with a clear span of two hundred and
sixty feet, squeezing itself, as it were, around the rocky face of
the mountain on the right bank, to be received with the same
grudging hospitality by the hard face of the left bank, and twists
itself by a very short curve into line, which in a very few minutes
brings it into the beautiful, smiling valley of Hot Springs.</p>

<p class='c011'>No one has ever been able to convey a just idea of the
remarkable magnificence of this wonderful cañon, with its wild
and ceaseless splendor of tumultuous waters, its overhanging
cliffs, its noble mountains and fairy islets. In the time of stage-coaching
it was an experience never to be forgotten—the day’s
journey from Asheville to the Warm Springs, along the turnpike
which followed the old Indian trail and lay between the river and
the cliffs, hemmed in by the whirling emerald waters of the first
and overhung by the fern-draped escarpments of the last, with
vistas of wild and yet wilder beauty opening at every step.</p>

<p class='c011'>Paint Rock is six miles below Hot Springs, and directly on
the line between North Carolina and Tennessee. The rock itself
is massive in size and would attract attention, if not admiration,
aside from the legends which make it famous. The name Paint
Rock is given to perpetuate a tradition that the Cherokee Indians
colored portions of it with an indelible paint, and in the form of
hieroglyphics which no one has been able to decipher, though
the legend represents that it is the tribe’s prayer to the Great
Spirit; and being approved, ages will not suffice to efface it. Twenty miles east of Asheville is Round Knob, on the line of the Western
North Carolina Railroad and nestled in the very heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains, where the scenery surpasses in wildness and sublimity
that of any other section of the State. It is a basin so completely shut in by lofty peaks, that if a person were dropped into it without
knowing the point of entrance, he would find difficulty in escaping. A brawling mountain stream rushes by, in whose crystal waters bask
the speckled trout to tempt the angler, while near the hotel is to be seen one of the most beautiful spectacles in the world—a magnificent
fountain that throws its spray two hundred and eighty-six feet high, then like a bridal veil floats off in misty fragments. It is beautiful
by day, but far more beautiful in the moonlight, as it throws its sparkling vapor high in the air, giving to the scene a weird enchantment.</p>

<p>CÆSAR’S HEAD, SPUR OF THE BLUE RIDGE RANGE, N. C.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Overhead, apparently weaving in and out like a silver thread,
winds the glistening track over which the tourist must pass to gain the
summit of the Blue Ridge. So great and difficult is the ascent that at
one point four parallel tracks may be seen, one above the other, while
at another point, as the train passes over a winding trestle sixty feet
high, the tourist might easily drop his hat on the track below over
which he had passed a few minutes before, but now going in an entirely
opposite direction, having gained nothing on his journey save about
ninety feet in elevation. So often does the track turn, twist and double
upon itself to gain the summit, that at one place of observation it
may be seen at seventeen distinct points. After having gained a distance
of over five miles of the ascent, the train is again within one-fourth
of a mile of the Knob, now lying far below, but still the center of this
grand system of iron loops, by means of which the train is gradually
rising to the region of the clouds. From this point to the summit, in
the short space of one and a half miles, the train passes through six
tunnels and across numerous gorges, whose sides are clothed with the
primeval forest where perhaps the foot of man never trod. The most
noted of these is “Royal Gorge,” seen from the car window, whose
precipitous sides and deep-yawning chasm form a scene of magnificent
grandeur, from the top of whose butting cliffs the mountains of South
Carolina are visible, two hundred miles distant. As the train rushes
forward, suddenly it plunges into Swannanoa Tunnel, which is nearly
two thousand feet long, and upon emerging at the western end, along
the massive walls, we reach the highest point in that Land of the
Sky, where the waters of a spring divide, a part flowing into the Atlantic
Ocean and an equal share being contributed to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains and passed through
Hickory-Nut Gap to the valley, the road leads into one of the grandest
cañons of the Broad River. Here for a distance of nine miles on either
side of the river giant mountains rise to a dizzy height, forming massive
walls of blue granite, often reaching a height of more than a thousand
feet, while not a sprig of vegetation appears on their surface.</p>

<p class='c011'>A creek large enough to turn a mill plunges over one of these
embattlements and falls in a single stream a distance of over thirteen
hundred feet, known as Hickory-Nut Falls, said to be the third highest
falls in the United States. Passing on down this great gorge, we see
Chimney Rock on the right, a circular column four hundred feet high,
while on the opposite side is Round Top, with its pyramidal dome resting
against the sky.</p>

<p>CHIMNEY ROCK, ON THE FRENCH BROAD RIVER.—<span class="multicaption">After passing through the Blue Ridge Mountains at Hickory Nut Gap, the valley of the French Broad River is encompassed by one of the grandest cañons to be found in any part of the world. For a distance of nine miles on either side, giant mountains rise to a dizzy height, forming massive walls of blue granite, often reaching an altitude of more than a thousand feet, while not a sprig of vegetation appears on their surface. They are cut and carved by the elements into many curious and remarkable shapes, designated by names more or less appropriate. Chimney Rock, photographed on this page, is a circular column four hundred feet high, bearing upon its top a curiously shaped rock closely resembling the cap of liberty.</span></p>

<p>ABOVE THE CLOUDS ON MITCHELL’S PEAK, NEAR ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“High mountains bound this vale on north and south, while directly in front of us, like companion sentinels guarding the western
gateway, down which the sun was to march, stands Round Top and Chimney Rock Mountains. Behind Chimney Rock, trending toward
the west, arise in close succession a number of mountains with distinct, broken summits—a long palisade fencing the gap in whose depth
rushes the Broad River. In the center of the west stands Bear Wallow Mountain, the last visible knob of Hickory-Nut Gap.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The sun was sinking behind the white cumuli that capped this mountain. Streamers of golden light, like the spokes of a celestial
chariot, whose hub was the hidden sun, barred the western sky. The clouds shone with edges of beaten gold. Their centers, with every
minute, changed to all hues imaginable. The fronts of the Sentinel Mountains were somber in the shadows, while the gap was radiant with
the light pouring through it, and every pine on the top of the palisade stood black against the glowing sky.” The “Old Man’s Face” is
another wonderful natural curiosity
which divides interest with
the finest scenery in this remarkable
region, and is on the
west side of Bald Mountain, in
prominent view, for the rocks
are barren and garish from the
light of the sun. This singular
formation is a faithful representation
of a three-quarter view of
an old man’s face, with forehead,
eyes, nose, mouth and
beard in such perfect proportion
that one can hardly believe,
without close examination, the
face is only an accidental result
of the elements, in their unceasing
work of denudation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Eighteen miles from Asheville,
in the Balsam Range, is
Mount Pisgah, 5,757 feet high,
from the apex of which a wonderful
expanse of mountain
scenery is spread out to view;
but it is from the Blue Ridge
peaks that the sublimest visions are presented, and the most curious forms of nature-sculpturing occur. Passing southwest from Asheville,
the Asheville and Spartanburg Road runs through an exceedingly fertile region, and thence into the Cañon of Little River, where for four
miles the stream is a succession of surging rapids, noisy cascades, and picturesque waterfalls, until it approaches the base of tremendous
cliffs. These are spurs of the Blue Ridge, one of which is famous as presenting a facial profile which has been named “Cæsar’s Head,”
but it takes a person of vivid imagination to distinguish the human features, very plain though the guide declares them to be. As the
altitude is nearly 6,000 feet, and 2,000 feet above the valley, the prospect of the peak of this Blue Ridge spur is incomparably magnificent.</p>

<p>THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT MITCHELL, NORTH CAROLINA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From this dizzy height the peaks of the Blue Ridge may be observed for scores of miles in each direction; looking northeast you
may see the famous King’s Mountain, seventy miles away, while in the opposite direction, in distinct view, is Stone Mountain, near Atlanta,
Georgia, over one hundred miles away. Looking to the north, a distance of a little more than one hundred miles, is the Roan Mountain,
while to the northeast is seen the black dome of Mount Mitchell, full sixty-five miles distant. In the northwest, about thirty-five miles
away, is Pisgah, resembling a great Egyptian pyramid in outline, while directly to the west are the Highlands of Macon county, with Whiteside
Mountain glittering like an
iceberg in the sunlight. From
the top of this wonderful precipice
the view is strangely suggestive
of a great stretch of
ocean. The blue waves of the
sea find their counterpart in
the waves of these blue mountains,
with their corrugations
extending far out until the outline
is lost in the hazy distance.
There is no grander sight than
a view from this point at sunrise,
when the world below is
buried from sight in an ocean
of impenetrable fog, and the
great billows of fleecy mist rolling
like angry waves, while the
breaker-like roar of cataracts a
thousand feet below, makes the
deception complete.</p>

<p class='c011'>The loftiest peak of the
Appalachian system is Mount
Mitchell, which is thirty miles
from Asheville, and is easiest
reached by way of the Swannanoa
River. The ascent is by a
comparatively easy roadway,
but as the altitude of the summit
is 6,717 feet, it is not gained
without great exertion. Formerly
the mountain was called
Black Dome, then Clingman’s Mount, but was afterwards christened Mitchell’s Peak, in honor of Professor Elisha Mitchell, of the State
University of North Carolina, who was first to measure its exact altitude, and who lost his life by falling over a precipice in making a second
ascent to verify his first measurement. The body was found ten days after the fatal accident and conveyed to Asheville, where it was
buried. One year subsequently the remains were disinterred and carried to the summit of Mitchell Mountain, and there committed to the
grave, over which a beautiful monument now stands, the tribute of a
daughter’s loving memory.</p>

Out of these molds of nature, after the mud had been mostly removed by flowing water, came these marvelous formations, rivaling in beauty and wonder the most exquisite carvings of art. The “Throne-Room,” so beautifully photographed on this page, is canopied with curtains and hung with tapestry that seem to be woven of pearls and diamonds, rivaling the splendors of Aladdin’s fabled cave.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The ascent of the mountain lies through superb forests of
deciduous trees and along the banks of the rushing Swannanoa, until
after a climb of five miles the second base of the mountain is reached—a
small grassy plateau, where a residence once stood—now known as
the “Half-way House.” From this point the world below unrolls
before the gaze like an azure scroll, while above, awful in its nearness
and immensity, towers the dark mass of Black Mountain, clothed with
a somber forest, into the depths of which the path now plunges, and
which it does not leave again until the final summit is reached. Winding
in snake-like turns through the close-growing firs, the trail climbs
the steep shoulders of the great mountain, passing over what is now
known as Clingman Dome (of the Blacks) and then following its
ridges for about three miles, until the bare rocky peak, which is the
highest point of land east of the Rocky Mountains, is reached, and all
hardships of ascent are forgotten in the view that bursts upon the
enraptured vision.</p>

<p class='c011'>If the day is clear, the prospect is almost boundless in extent and
of infinite beauty. Range behind range of great mountains lie below,
like a Titanic ocean stilled by some mighty hand. From this supreme
elevation it is possible to study the structural character of the region,
and to count all the great chains that cross the country, while no words
can express the varying and exquisite color that, like a glamour of heavenly
enchantment, lies over the wide expanse. The whole earth, “and
the beauty thereof,” seems to be spread out at one’s feet, and the airs
that come to this high mountain crest are full of freshness and balm.</p>

<p class='c011'>A Southern poet, who climbed the mountain in the spring of
1891, thus describes the inspiring sight which greeted him when the
day was dying: “To witness a sunset from this peak is something
long to be remembered. Never shall I forget that evening in June,
when in company with my guide, we stood by the grave on the summit
of Mount Mitchell, and looked down on that scene of resplendent
glory that lay before us; far in the west the sun was slowly sinking
in a bed of crimson and gold, the horizon was lighted with a flushing
radiance which was infinitely sublime, while the whole landscape was
aglow with splendor, every tint and hue imaginable seemed to intermingle
in that sea of color, and every jutting crag, and dome, and
pinnacle of sullen rock flamed as though a thousand rainbows had
fallen out of the sky and hung themselves there like glorious banners;
we stand enthralled at the scene before us, no sound is heard, no note of bird breaks the awful stillness. We are in the region of that
eternal silence which wraps the summit of the ‘everlasting hills.’ A hush of dreamy repose broods over this lofty peak, which still retains
the last rays of the setting sun, while over the world below twilight has fallen.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it is not only from its
unsurpassed view that this great
mountain is interesting. Its
vast sides are clothed with a
forest of bewildering beauty,
crystal streams gush from its
heights, and there is, altogether,
a fascination about this wild,
unpeopled region that goes far to
account for the passion which
caused Professor Mitchell to lose
his life in wandering through
its wilderness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having accomplished a circuit
of the wonderlands of
Western North Carolina, our
artist departed from Asheville
by way of the Richmond and
Danville Railroad, and thence
by its northern connections to
Roanoke, Virginia, at which
point train was taken on the
Shenandoah Valley Route for Luray, a town of 1,500 people, but famous by reason of its proximity to the marvelous caverns of that name,
the beauty of which is incomparable, and in wonder they rival the great Mammoth Cave. This marvelous subterranean labyrinth is one
mile distant from the town, and is entered by an easy passage-way that has a gradual descent by stone steps. The cave was an accidental
discovery by Mr. Andrew J. Campbell, in 1878, who, while examining the locality known as Cave Hill, was led, by the hollow sound
produced by stamping the earth, to seek for the cavity which he knew must exist at that point. With spade and mattock he sank a hole
four feet deep and was rewarded by finding the great cavern which ought rightfully to bear his name.</p>

<p>FACTORY FALLS, DINGMAN’S FERRY, PENNSYLVANIA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>To Rev. Horace C. Hovey, of New Haven, we are indebted for the best, as it is the most interesting, description that has ever been
written of this underground wonderland, prepared as it was after a careful examination of the geology of the cave as well as of its splendors:</p>

<p class='c011'>“At some period, long subsequent to its original excavation, and after many large stalactites had grown, the cavern was completely
filled with glacial mud, whereby the drip-stone was eroded into singularly grotesque shapes. After the mud had been mostly removed by
flowing water, these eroded forms remained amid the new growths. To this contrast may be ascribed some of the most striking scenes
of the cave. The many, and extraordinary monuments of aqueous energy include massive columns wrenched from their place in the ceiling
and prostrate on the floor; the hollow column forty feet high and thirty feet in diameter, standing erect, but pierced by a tubular
passage from top to bottom; the leaning column, nearly as large, undermined and tilting like the Campanila of Pisa; the organ, a cluster of
stalactites, dropped point downward, and standing thus in the room known as the Cathedral; besides a vast bed of disintegrated carbonates
left by the whirling flood in its retreat through the great space called the Elfin Ramble.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The stalactite display exceeds that of any other cavern known, and there is hardly a square yard on the walls or ceiling that is not
thus ornamented. The old
material is yellow, brown or red,
and its wavy surface often shows
layers like the gnarled grain of
costly woods. The new stalactites
growing from the old, and
made of hard carbonates that
had already once been used, are
usually white as snow, though
often pink, blue or amber-colored.
The size attained by
single specimens is surprising.
The Empress Column is a stalagmite
thirty-five feet high, rose-colored
and elaborately draped.
The Double Column is made of
two fluted pillars side by side,
the one twenty-five, the other
sixty feet high, a mass of snowy
alabaster. Several stalactites
in the Giant’s Hall exceed fifty
feet in length. The small
pendants are innumerable; in
the canopy above the Imperial
Spring it is estimated that forty
thousand are visible at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Cascades are wonderful
formations, like foaming cataracts caught in mid-air, and transformed into milk-white or amber alabaster, while the Chalcedony Cascade
displays a variety of colors. Brand’s Cascade, which is the finest of all, being forty feet high, and almost as wide, is unsullied and wax-like
white, each ripple and braided rill appearing to have been polished.</p>

<p>CADEDENEAN FALLS, DINGMAN’S FERRY.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“The Swords of the Titans are monstrous blades, eight in number, fifty feet long, three to eight feet wide, and one to two feet
thick, but are hollow and drawn down to an extremely fine edge, filling the cavern with tones like tolling bells, when struck by the
hand. Their origin, and also that of certain so-called scarfs and blankets exhibited, is from carbonates deposited by water trickling down
a sloping and corrugated surface. Sixteen of these alabaster scarfs hang side by side in Hovey’s Balcony, three white and fine as crape
shawls, thirteen striated like agate, with every shade of brown, and all perfectly transparent. Down the edge of each a tiny rill glistens
like silver, and this is the ever-plying shuttle that weaves this fairy fabric.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Streams and true springs are absent, but there are hundreds of basins, varying from one to fifty feet in diameter, and from six
inches to fifteen feet in depth. The water in them is exquisitely pure, except as it is impregnated by the carbonate of lime, which often
forms concretions called, according to their size, pearls, eggs, and snow-balls. A large one is known as the Cannon-Ball. When fractured,
these spherical growths are found to be radiated in structure. Calcite crystals, drusy, feathery, or fern-like, line the sides and bottoms of every
water-filled cavity, and, indeed,
constitute the substance of which
they are formed. Variations
of level at different periods are
marked by rings, ridges, and
ruffled margins. These are
especially strongly marked
about Broaddus Lake, and the
curved ramparts of the Castles
on the Rhine. Here, also, are
polished stalagmites, a rich buff
slashed with white, and others,
like huge mushrooms, with a
velvety coat of red, purple, or
olive-tinted crystals. In some
of the smaller basins it sometimes
happens that when the
excess of carbonic acid escapes
rapidly there is formed, besides
the crystal beds below, a film
above, shot like a sheet of ice
across the surface. One pool
twelve feet wide is thus covered
so as to show but a third of its
surface. The quantity of water
varies greatly at different seasons;
hence some stalactites
have their tips under water long enough to allow tassels of crystal to grow on them, which in a drier season are again coated over with
stalactitic matter, by which singular distortions are occasioned. Contiguous stalactites are often enwrapped thus till they assume an almost
globular form, through which, by making a section, the primary tubes appear. Twig-like projections, lateral outgrowths, to which the
term <i>helictite</i> has been applied, are met with in certain portions of the cave, and are interesting by reason of their strange and uncouth
contortions. Their presence is partly due to the existence of a diminutive fungus peculiar to the locality, and designated from its habitat,
<i>Mucor Stalactitis</i>. The Toy Shop is an amusing collection of these freaks of nature.</p>

<p>FARM SCENE IN THE VALLEY OF THE SHENANDOAH, VIRGINIA.—<span class="multicaption">The war between the States found the valley of the Shenandoah an ideal pastoral country, of rich and beautiful farms, of wealthy and aristocratic families, where life in its ease and sunshine rivaled that in older lands. The war left it a bare, blackened and blasted region, its homes destroyed, its farms desolated, and its able-bodied population decimated in the field. But it has fully recovered again. Grass and grain have woven Nature’s beautiful covering over all the scars of battle, and once more the fields and orchards are laden with flowers, while the lowing of the cattle and the song of the contented husbandman are heard in place of the discordant drum and the ruthless clash of arms.</span></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>“The dimensions of the various chambers included in Luray Caverns cannot be given, on account of the great irregularity of their
outlines. Nor can their size be estimated from a diagram, because there are several tiers of galleries, and the vertical depth, from the
highest to the lowest, is two hundred and sixty feet. The tract of one hundred acres, owned by the Luray Cave Company, covers all possible
modes of entrance, and the explored area is much less than that. The waters of this cavern appear to be entirely destitute of life; and
the existing fauna is quite meager, comprising a few bats, rats, mice, spiders, flies and small centipedes. When the cave was first entered
the floor was covered with thousands of tracks of bears, wolves and raccoons, most of them probably made long ago, as impressions in the
tenacious clay that composes most of the cavern-floor would remain for centuries. The traces of human occupation, as yet discovered, are
pieces of charcoal, flints, moccasin tracks, and a single skeleton imbedded in a stalagmite in one of the chasms, estimated to have lain where
found for not more than five hundred years, judging from the present rate of stalagmitic growth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Accurate and beautiful as is Mr. Hovey’s description of Luray Caverns, yet words, however ingeniously used, fail utterly to convey
a true idea of the incomparable splendors of this under-world palace which gleams with unspeakable glories, such as God alone can create.
Aladdin, in the Arabic tale which so delighted our youthful fancy, was permitted to enter a cave which exhibited such decorations that its
very beauty both dazzled and affrighted; and to his amazement was added the greater wonder, that the cavern thus wrought of precious
stones was the work of a geni, who was slave to a lamp and ring. But the fervid imagination of youth, or the dreamer under
influence of the delirium-inducing hasheesh intoxicant in India’s climes, never riveted gaze upon vision more wondrously beautiful than
Luray’s intervals of divine architecture; nor was Aladdin’s Cave half so charming. The Throne-Room, canopied with curtains woven of
pearls and diamonds; “The Saracen’s Tent,” in which more than oriental splendors of richest damasks and golden samite sweep round
the crystal couch in festoons of magic beauty; Titania’s Veil of petrified spider’s webs and crystallized harmonies, behind which the queen
of fairies hides from Æolus; and the Ball-Room, with best adornments, as if to celebrate a marriage between the gods; all these and
many more, in fast succession of admiring surprise, compose the Caverns of Luray, of which it has been said: “Mortal hath not made the
like, nor human fancy conceived a thing more magnificent.” Let the illustrations herewith convey an idea of the beauty which
language cannot express.</p>

<p class='c011'>The uniform temperature of the cave is 54° Fahrenheit, which is the same as Mammoth Cave, and as the chamber-floors are dry,
visitors are not fatigued or discomforted by long walks through the labyrinthine passages, where every step taken brings fresh marvels into
view. To the curiously inclined the inquiry, not often asked, will appear very interesting: How did the animals whose foot-prints were
noticed in the tenacious clay, by those who made the discovery, get into the cave? The opening by which the chambers are reached is an
artificial one, made at the point where Mr. Campbell detected the hollow by stamping on the ground, as explained. No other ingress is yet
known, though the cave has not been thoroughly explored; so it is possible, or probable even, that other means of entrance have long
continued open, but the possibility also remains that its entering passage-ways may have been sealed up by an invasion of glacial drift,
since the flood; marks of that tremendous cataclysm are plainly to be seen in the cave, and not all of the diluvium deposit has been yet
removed or ground under foot by the 10,000 persons who visit the caverns annually.</p>

<p class='c011'>A trip up the Shenandoah Valley, though made in a luxurious coach on a swift-moving train, is attended by innumerable reminders
of the great civil war, for the journey is over a succession of hotly-contested battle-fields; but the beautiful scenery, rich lands, and lovely
farm scenes that now compose the landscape, cannot efface the recollection which monuments and cemeteries constantly revive. General
Boynton has drawn a truthful picture of this war-famous section, in this wise:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Every foot south of the Potomac was fighting-ground; every town was, at some time, the headquarters of well-known forces;
nearly every farm house was a hospital, and some of the dead and wounded of the many contests had fallen on every acre. On the Union
side Fremont and Sigel, Milroy and Shields, Hunter and Banks, Kelley and Crook, Wilson and Sheridan, and others of note had there met
Jackson, Ewell, Early, Stewart, Ashby, and the advance of Lee in force. There were innumerable small affairs, and many extended and
fierce engagements. Columns in advance and in retreat ebbed and flowed there through every year of the war; while every gap opening
eastward poured its footmen and its horsemen upon the flanks, first of the one army, and then of the other. From the opening of the contest
till is close it was the vortex of strategy. The war found it an ideal pastoral country, of rich and beautiful farms, of wealthy and aristocratic
families, where life in its ease and sunshine rivaled that in older lands. It was the granary and store-house of the Confederacy.
The war left it a bare, blackened, and blasted region, its homes destroyed, its farms desolated, and its able-bodied population decimated in
the field. But it has fully recovered again. Grass and grain have woven nature’s beautiful covering over all scars of battle, and the
countless miles of parapets are green each year with verdure, and the fields and orchards are laden with flowers again.”</p>

<p>HARPER’S FERRY, WEST VIRGINIA, FROM BOLIVAR HEIGHTS.—<span class="multicaption">Harper’s Ferry is a place of great scenic as well as historic interest; but it is the magnificent scenery surrounding the place that now chiefly attracts the tourist’s attention. From Maryland Heights, on the opposite side of the Potomac, the observer is able to look into seven counties and across stretches of three States, the view being at last arrested by a soft haze that crowns the summit of the Blue Ridge range.

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>The southwestern branch of the Baltimore and Ohio skirts the Cumberland Range, following the valley of the Shenandoah, until it
joins the main line at Harper’s Ferry, where the Shenandoah and Potomac likewise form a junction, each stream cleaving a way through
the mountains and watering a region of extraordinary scenic beauty. Sheridan, when operating in these valleys, declared that the country
was so barren that a crow would have to carry its rations when flying over it; but the country has blossomed into fertility since that time,
and now presents glorious visions of great productiveness, as well as bluffs and mountains of rugged picturesqueness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Harper’s Ferry was well known before the war as being the location of one of the important Government armories and arsenals,
which were destroyed soon after the beginning of hostilities, and have not since been rebuilt. Its chief fame, however, is derived from the
fact that the town was the seat of the John Brown insurrection (in October, 1859); and at Charleston, seven miles distant, on the road to
Winchester, is the place where he was tried and executed. Harper’s Ferry was thus not only the scene of the opening events of the war,
but it remained the center of action for a long time, being alternately occupied by the Union and Confederate forces, who contended with
varying fortunes, but always with immense loss of life, in efforts to retain it as a base for their supplies. It is the magnificent scenery
surrounding the place that now attracts the tourist’s interest, for a more beautiful section of mountain country is nowhere to be seen in the
East. Particularly fine views are afforded from Maryland Heights, on the opposite side of the Potomac, and from Bolivar Heights, which are
above the town, the latter being a more extensive perspective, commanding as it does a long stretch of river and the huge mountain ramparts
on the south. From this point of observation, too, the Shenandoah River is presented to the view, sprinkled with white-crested
waves dashing over smooth-worn bowlders, that have long lain in its course, and its frowning shores that rise up into towering mountains
and form a chain of peaks that girdle the horizon. From Maryland Heights the observer is able to look into seven counties, and across
stretches of three States, the view being at last arrested by a soft haze that crowns the soaring summits of the Blue Ridge Range. The
route from Harper’s Ferry was north by way of the Baltimore and Ohio and the Cumberland Valley Railroads to Harrisburg, and thence
some of the fine scenery of Pennsylvania was visited, particularly that which lies along the line of the Pennsylvania Railroad. In going
East, the first view of great interest which greets the eyes of observant travelers along this road, after leaving Pittsburgh, is Johnstown, a
great manufacturing place, at the confluence of Conemaugh River and Stony Creek, but whose largest fame dates from June 1, 1889,
when the town was swept by one of the most appalling cataclysms that has found a record in history. On that ever-memorable date the
immense reservoir away up in the Alleghenies that held the waters of South Fork, burst without warning and rushed down, a very devastating
monster, into the smiling valley, which it overwhelmed with a flood forty feet deep. The result is too awful to dwell upon; two
thousand people were whirled to their death, and the city was carried from its foundations, with a loss of $10,000,000. But Johnstown
has recovered from the terrible blow which it received on that opening day of summer, and the blazing forge of the rolling-mills has
again brought prosperity to the place.</p>

<p>THE HORSESHOE CURVE AT KITTANNING, PENNSYLVANIA.—<span class="multicaption">This point is in one of the finest scenic localities of the great State of Pennsylvania, the rolling and broken hills rising in many places almost to the dignity of mountains. The valleys and sloping sides of the hills are covered with rich and well-cultivated farms, adorned with elegant farm-houses, barns and other improvements, superior to almost any of the other rural districts of our country. It is a region also famous for fruits of various kinds, and in the early spring the whole country seems abloom with the apple, peach, pear and other fragrant and familiar blossoms.</span></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>Beyond Johnstown a magnificent panorama of the Alleghenies breaks into view with their myriad phases of beauty and grandeur.
As we follow down the Conemaugh, along the breast of the mountains are the remains of inclined planes of the Portage Railroad, by which
loaded canal-boats were transported over the mountains at points where the canal was not yet constructed. This was before the days of
steam railroads, when canals were the most expeditious mode of freight transportation. Beyond Cressons the road begins the ascent of the
Alleghenies, and in doing so makes many turns, and from the right hand of the road a gorgeous spectacle is presented looking down into
the valleys, where the houses are dwarfed by distance until they look like mole-hills, and men are not distinguishable. There are horseshoe
curves as sharp and graceful as any on the roads that climb over western mountains, while the scene is often more picturesque because
of the high state of cultivation of the mountain slopes. A tunnel three-quarters of a mile in length pierces the brow of one of the highest
peaks, after which the road descends rapidly to Cressons, a place noted for its seven mineral springs. Altoona is next passed, and a few
minutes later the train rushes around the beautiful horseshoe curve at Kittanning, affording a charming prospect of lofty mountains,
surrounding a lake of exquisite beauty, made by damming a pretty stream that comes gamboling down from cool retreats in the high altitudes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Out of the Tuckahoe Valley and on to Tyrone, where the Little Juniata is reached, along whose sweet-smelling banks the road
hastens by Broad Top Mountain, Sliding Hill, through the gap of Jack’s Mountain, and thence into the Long Narrows, which is traversed
by highway, river and canal, running in competition with the railroad. For several miles the scenery is wondrously beautiful, with
kaleidoscopic glimpses of swift-passing mountain, foaming water-ways, laughing cascades, and bounty-bestowing valleys bedewed with the
delicious waters of the blue Juniata. Thence on to Harrisburg the road speeds, with many a twist through smiling vales that swathe the
mountain’s feet with ribbons of verdure; across the Susquehanna, where the river is more than a mile wide and freckled with impeding
stones. Lancaster is soon reached, and thence eastward the scenery grows in grandeur until Chester Valley is passed and Paoli comes into
view. This place is famous in history from the fact that here took place a massacre which will be remembered for ages as a reproach to
the British. On September 20, 1777, the American forces under General Anthony Wayne were surprised by a large army of British
regulars, commanded by General Gray. Notwithstanding the superior numbers of the enemy and his unpreparedness, General Wayne
offered a stubborn resistance, and not until nearly one-half his men had fallen in the desperate conflict did he capitulate, upon terms of
honorable surrender. Instead of observing the rules which obtain among civilized nations, after the Americans had laid down their arms
the British mercilessly slaughtered many of their helpless prisoners. A monument, erected in 1817, marks the site of this shameful
tragedy. Eastward from Paoli the road traverses one of the fairest sections in the world, resembling the richest agricultural regions of
England, where the soil is in the highest possible state of cultivation and the farm houses are models of architectural elegance, with a
gradual increase in the beauties of the prosperous landscape until the train pursues its way through Fairmount Park and into the great
metropolis of Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c011'>Northward from Philadelphia our artist traveled, through Bethlehem to the Delaware Water Gap, where the Delaware River forges
its way through the Blue Mountains, the point of passage being narrowed by walls from 1,200 to 1,600 feet high, which seem to clasp the
sturdy stream in colossal arms, of half affection and half restraint. This tremendous gorge formerly bore the Indian name of Minnisink,
signifying “Whence the waters are gone,” which is thus explained by a local geologist: “Here a vast lake once probably extended; and
whether the great body of water wore its way through the mountain by a fall like Niagara, or burst through a gorge, it is certain that the
Minnisink country bears the mark of aqueous action in its diluvial soil, and in its rounded hills, built of pebbles and bowlders.” The gap
proper is about two miles long, when the mountains recede on both sides, as if at one time some terrific disturbance had thrown up a giant
ridge in the path of the river. It is apparent also that centuries ago the passage, though hardly more than one hundred yards wide now,
was very much narrower, and the name given to it by the Indians was no doubt suggested by this cleft through which the pent-up waters
must have dashed with terrific force and roar.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>The two mountains between which the river passes are named in honor of two famous Indian chiefs, that on the New Jersey side
being called Tammany, and the one on the Pennsylvania shore being known as Minsi. Chief Tammany was of the Delaware tribe, whose
bravery and magnanimity was such that he was canonized as the patron saint of America, but his name is best perpetuated by New York
City’s political organization. The two mountains, adjacent, and which were no doubt one before the wearing waters cut a way through it,
exhibit marked differences, which, to a casual observer, would seem to controvert this theory. Mount Minsi is a graceful peak crowned
with dense forest growths, while Tammany is a gigantic rock that rises in broken ledges, almost terraces, from the river, on one of which,
two hundred feet above the river, a hotel has been built to accommodate summer tourists. And the scenery is grand enough to lure lovers
of the picturesque in nature. Just below the hotel falls a silvery cascade whose waters are derived from Hunter’s Spring, that bursts out of
the mountain side, and perambulates through many sequestered nooks, moss-covered and beflowered, before it drops into a pool called
Diana’s Bath, thence over Caldeno Falls, and slides into the river. Above the source of the waterfall is a lofty ledge known as Lover’s
Leap, and to the left another promontory called Prospect Rock, while near-by is a clear lake on the very apex of the mountain, which
visitors are told is of an unfathomable depth.</p>

<p class='c011'>But though Tammany is the more ruggedly picturesque, Minsi offers the more entrancing prospect, expanding on the east until the
whole of New Jersey seems to be spread out to view. A mile below the Gap the scenery becomes curiously pretty, for the river has worn
the banks into grottoes and fantastic forms. Here are such objects of interest as Indian Ladder Bluff, Cold-Air Cave, Point of Rocks,
Bumer’s Spring, etc., while a few miles above the Gap there are bits of nature positively charming. Bushkill Creek pours its contribution
into the Delaware five miles from the Gap and a few hundred yards from its outlet the stream tumbles over a precipice twenty feet high in
a sheet of water that looks like a curtain of lace. On an affluent of the Bushkill are two other cataracts of even greater beauty, known as
Buttermilk and Marshall, both of which may be reached in a half-hour’s walk from the river, and are within seven miles of the hotel on
Tammany’s ledge. A feature of the Water Gap, which vies in interest with the natural scenery, is the railroad-bed around the base of
Tammany, where it exacts a space from both the river and the mountain, in order to secure sufficient width for passage. At this point the
gap is narrowest and the cliffs most stupendous, right where the jaws of the gorge are set in firmest resolution to prevent a full flow of the
river, and where a rushing current betrays irritation at the impediment by a ceaseless roar.</p>

<p class='c011'>Twenty-five miles above the Water Gap is another section of wild and weirdly grand scenery, where Dingman’s Creek carols through
the copses and takes a header into the Delaware, like a swimmer at the bath. Dingman’s Ferry is a small hamlet containing a score of
houses, but what it lacks in population is made up in public interest by its picturesque surroundings. The region is intersected by numerous
streams, which are noted for their impetuous courses and numerous falls. Of these Colosseum Falls are the largest, and by many are
regarded as the most beautiful; but Bridal Veil Falls are more exquisitely fascinating to the artist. The stream is not large, but the
precipice is high, and so gracefully terraced that the water makes a succession of leaps, and each time is spread by the ledges until at its
last fall it is as airy as a bride’s veil. Its sedgy banks and bosky shelves add to the general effect in a way that compels the thought of
fairy bowers and naiads’ retreats. Factory Falls are the largest cataracts of this sylvan region, pouring a considerable volume of water over
serrated brinks, and twisting around in shapely ways that add ineffable grace to the boiling, laughing and playful waters. Cadedenean
Falls are almost as graceful, but are spread over a greater surface, and fall into the creek in the form of an outspread fan. The “Brakes
and Braes of Bonny Doon” were not more charming to the eyes of the poet than the soul-delighting coverts and falls about Dingman’s.
In the spring-time these streams are swollen to immense proportions, and it is then that the falls display their greatest grandeur, filling the
woods with their torrential orisons; but in summer they exhibit the most marvelous graces, for it is then the waters are crystalline in their
purity, and the dewy mosses along their brinks look like garlands of diamonds, which the branches of bordering thickets stoop down to kiss.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Dingman’s Ferry our photographer passed on to Milford, and thence by the Erie Road to New York City, where a junction
was made with the two other photographers for a trip to the sunny lands of the South.</p>

New York City possesses many attractions for the cosmopolitan, but not for the artist, who prefers nature’s solitudes to the artificial
glamor and noisy hum of a large city; hence our stay in that city was only for such time as it required to make preparations for
extending our pictorial journey through summer lands of the southeast. Instead of carrying our original plans into immediate
execution, however, it was decided to visit the battle-field of Gettysburg, which our artist coming up through Virginia and
Pennsylvania did not find it convenient to include in his journey. The town of Gettysburg has a population of some 3,500 souls,
and is the capital of Adams county, Pennsylvania, the center of a blooming and bounteously-producing agricultural district. Our
route to reach the place was by way of the Pennsylvania Railroad to Hanover, and thence by the Western Maryland Railroad, a distance of
250 miles from New York. The landscape thereabout is undulating, occasionally rising to hills of considerable size; but scenically there is
nothing particularly attractive,
aside from the beautiful farms
and truck-gardens that clothe
the knolls with prodigal harvests.
Historically, the place
is imperishably famous, for here
was fought, on the 1st, 2d and
3d of July, 1863, the bloodiest
and hottest-contested battle of
the civil war. From every eminence
this dreadful field, though
it now smiles with plenty, still
presents memorials of that ever-memorable
conflict. There is
Cemetery Hill, the old grave-place
of the town, where thousands
slept before the awakening
alarms of cannon and musket
enveloped the scene in battle-smoke.
Here it was that the
Union forces, under General
Meade, pitched their quarters,
because it commanded a view of
the adjacent country. One mile
towards the west is Seminary
Ridge, the spot chosen by the
Confederates, under General Lee,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>as their vantage-point and headquarters. Now sweep the horizon and mark the places where the battle waxed fiercest; where the dead lay
thickest and the thunder of conflict was loudest. There is Willoughby Run, where the battle began and where Buford’s cavalry was
hurled upon the steel of Hill, and for two hours withstood the hell of ball and bayonet until flesh could endure no more. There is Round
Top, another eminence where the Union lines reformed, with the left wing thrown around the ridges to Cemetery Hill. There is where
Longstreet struck Sickles with
such fearless resolution, and a
whole day was spent in a contention
for Great and Little
Round Top, without advantage
to either side, but with frightful
losses to both. Now on Cemetery
Hill the eyes of the world
must rest, for here it was, on the
third day, that such fighting was
done as Greek nor Roman ever
knew. After a lull at midday,
two hundred brazen throats
were opened with boom and
screaming shells; the air became
filled with smoke, and the earth
was choked with dead, until
there came a lull, out of which
broke a column three miles
long, whose gray uniforms soon
proclaimed the advance of General
Pickett leading his army
in a desperate resolve to storm
the Union position. No charge
ever made was more terrible,
no repulse was ever more fatal.
Americans, whatever be their
sympathies, whatever their
prejudices, may feel proud of
the heroism displayed by both
armies on that day of carnage
around Cemetery Hill. It was
a courage that glorifies America.</p>

<p>ROUND TOP, OVERLOOKING THE BATTLEFIELD OF GETTYSBURG.—<span class="multicaption">The battle that was fought at Gettysburg on the first, second and third of July, 1863, has been justly classed as one of the great battles of the world. It was the final turning-point in the war between the North and the South, and each side, on this field, displayed a heroism that will forever shed a light of glory upon the courage and fortitude of Americans as soldiers. Fifty-four thousand of our countrymen gave up their lives at Gettysburg. They were distinguished by uniforms of blue and gray then; now they are clothed with robes that are woven without color.

<p class='c011'>The 54,000 souls that laid down their arms and answered roll-call the morning of July 4th on the parade-grounds of paradise, were

<p class='c011'>Gettysburg is of itself a monument to human courage, but its field of blood has been made a national cemetery of seventeen acres,
which was dedicated with imposing ceremonies on November 19, 1863, at which President Lincoln made the greatest address ever
delivered on American soil, “With malice toward none, with charity for all.” A soldiers’ monument was erected in 1868, which is sixty
feet high, surmounted by a marble figure of Liberty, and occupies a crown of the hill, where it is a conspicuous object for miles,
and arranged in semi-circles about the base are the graves of nearly three thousand of the unidentified victims of the dreadful conflict.</p>

The wealthy pioneer who planned it took as his model some still older mansion of the merry England from which he had emigrated, and thus sought to transplant in the wilds of America a memorial of some loved spot in his native country. Its halls are now filled with the ghostly recollections of the past, for even the mighty events which took place in this immediate vicinity in April, 1865, seem almost like ancient history, so rapidly does time speed away on the wings of steam and electricity.</span></p>

<p>FORTRESS MONROE, VIRGINIA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From Gettysburg our
route was southwest to Washington,
and thence by way of
Fredericksburg to Appomattox.
From Washington the
Richmond, Fredericksburg
and Potomac Railroad runs
through a sterile section, unrelieved
by either picturesque
scenery or smiling field, so that
a part of it has long been known
as the Wilderness, famous, however,
as the scene of many great
battles in 1863-4, many traces
of which are still to be seen
from the car windows of passing
trains. Fredericksburg
is distinguished also as the
vicinity in which Washington
was born, and where he spent
the greater part of his youth.
Here it was also that Washington’s
mother lived for a long
time, and died in 1789. A
monument erected in 1883, in
the suburbs of the town, marks
the place of her sepulture. Twelve miles beyond Fredericksburg is the battle-ground of Spottsylvania Court House, where Stonewall
Jackson received his death wound, May 2, 1863. Indeed, the region for fifty miles thereabout is still scarred by the strokes of contending
armies delivered thirty years ago, and cemeteries in which repose the heroic dead of both Union and Confederate are numerous, marked
by many monuments to attest the appreciation of the living for the sacrifices which were endured in those dreadful years of the sixties. But
if the country is somewhat barren, and gruesome with reminders of fratricidal strife, it is not entirely destitute of the phases that lend
cheerfulness to life. Here is essentially the land of happy negroes, where poverty abounds with joy, for absence of responsibility is
contentment of mind with the colored race. At the depot there is always a swarm of pickaninnies eager to scramble for pennies thrown to
the crowd, and the most comical scenes imaginable occur at these tussles, for the little darkies themselves, in an array of all sizes and
shades of black and brown, a company of tatterdemalions that would put Punch and Judy to rout, are ludicrous enough to make a goat
laugh. The street-scenes of villages near-by, as well as in the suburbs of Fredericksburg, are equally whimsical, presenting, as they often
do, human nature in its most grotesque aspect. Horses are rarely used by negroes for draught purposes; mules more frequently; but
bulls, cows and yearling calves are the chief dependence, and carts the popular style of conveyance with these happy-go-lucky people.
There is no need for haste,
and the loads are never large,
hence a yoke of cattle are as
handy as a span of horses, and
preferable because slow movement
allows more sleep on the
way. The sun makes the
tobacco grow, and the rain
makes music on the cabin-roof;
so rain or shine the darkey’s
heart is always light and the
future is hidden from him by a
veil of present delight. Such
sights teach the value of content,
even if they do offend ambition,
and in them the philosopher’s
stone has its hiding-place.</p>

<p>DRUMMOND’S LAKE, IN GREAT DISMAL SWAMP, VIRGINIA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>From Fredericksburg our
route was northwest to Appomattox
and thence east by way
of Richmond to Fortress Monroe,
on the peninsula. We were
a little disappointed to find the
site of the culminating event of
the war destitute of any special
feature of interest of either a
natural or artificial character. The scene of surrender is not even marked by a monument, and the country thereabout is a pale and
somber stretch of poorly-cultivated lands. Yet there are exceptions; for occasionally the monotony of cabin and broken fence is relieved by
prolific tobacco-fields, pretty towns, and inviting manors adorned with colonial houses that still preserve their old-time air of comfort and
Southern hospitality. Virginia well deserves the title of the Dominion State, not only because she is the mother of Presidents, but
because she is also distinguished as the native state of many of the greatest men and women born on American soil. “To be a Virginian, is
to be a gentleman,” has passed into an adage; and the country is proud of her for a hundred reasons, which reference to history will explain.
If her soil is not the most fertile, yet her legacy is the richest, for she gave to the world such men as Washington, Madison, Jefferson,
Randolph, Clay, Lee and a thousand others whose names and deeds are alike imperishable. Fortress Monroe is reached by the Chesapeake
and Ohio Railroad, over which route we traveled from Appomattox. It is located at the point of a peninsula, formed by the Fork and
James Rivers, which projects into Chesapeake Bay where it joins the Atlantic. The situation is particularly favorable for a Government
fortress, and its natural and commanding advantages have been fully utilized, for it is the largest and strongest fortification in America.
Hampton Roads separates the point of the peninsula from the opposite land. This body of water is about five miles wide and forms the outlet
of James River. It was in the Roads that the most famous of modern naval battles, between the <i>Monitor</i> and the <i>Merrimac</i> (Virginia),
took place, March 9, 1862.
Two miles below Fortress
Monroe is Old Point Comfort,
a very popular resort
and the seat of the National
Soldiers’ Home.
Newport News is nine
miles above the Fortress,
on Hampton Roads; and
Yorktown, the place of
Cornwallis’ surrender to
Washington, October
19, 1781, is twenty-five
miles north, on York
River, both places possessing
great historic interest
for events of which
they were the scene during
the Revolutionary war.</p>

<p>OLD FORT AND SEA WALL AT ST. AUGUSTINE, FLORIDA.—<span class="multicaption">This old fort possesses a peculiar interest for Americans, being the oldest historic fortification of our country. Its construction was begun by Menendez de Aviles, a Spaniard, in 1565, but it was not completed until two centuries later. It was then called Fort San Marco, but with a ruthless disregard of historic associations characteristic of our people, it has been changed to Fort Marion, without in the least adding to the lustre of the renown of the great Revolutionary patriot of the South. The walls of the fort are composed of a conglomerate called coquina, which is formed of shells and sand brought from the island of Anastasia. Originally soft and pliable as plaster, it becomes almost of granitic hardness by exposure, affording a safe protection against the primitive artillery of that period.</span></p>

<p>A HUNTER’S CABIN ON THE CANAL, DISMAL SWAMP.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Crossing Hampton
Roads by steamer to Norfolk,
we proceeded southward
by the Norfolk
Southern Railroad,
through a region known
as the Dismal Swamp,
famous alike in fact and
fiction. The term has
been indelibly affixed to two extensive stretches of morass, the larger of which lies between the James River on the north and Albemarle
Sound on the south, thus covering a part of Virginia and North Carolina, having a length of about forty miles and a breadth of
twenty-five miles. Little Dismal Swamp is wholly within North Carolina, in the peninsula between Albemarle Sound and Pimlico
Sound, and while occupying considerably less than one-third as much area as Great Dismal, is probably better known to readers because of
the tragedies which have been enacted within its dark and gloomy districts. Speaking generally, the swamps are composed of a spongy,
vegetable soil, but without any mixture of earth, which supports a dense growth of aquatic plants, brush-wood and timber. Sir Charles
Lyell, the distinguished geologist, was first to bring to notice the curious fact that the surface of the swamp is actually twelve feet higher
in many places than the surrounding country, so that its drainage is outward, except where a few small streams flow in from the west side.
The center of Great Dismal is occupied by Drummond’s Lake, an oval basin six miles long and three wide, with perpendicular banks and
fifteen feet depth of water. In and around this lake is a veritable paradise for hunters, for its waters abound with fish and wild fowl, and
the adjacent woods are the favorite haunts of deer, bears, wild-cats, coons and swamp-rabbits. The region, inexpressibly dreary as it is,
contributes largely to commerce by furnishing immense supplies of timber. To facilitate transportation the Great Swamp is intersected by
canals, the two largest
being those which connect
the Elizabeth and
Pasquotank Rivers, and
Elizabeth River with
Carrituck Sound.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some queer little
cabins are built along
these water-ways, a few
being occupied by timber
cutters, but generally
they are the temporary
abodes of hunters who
find shooting and trapping
both pleasurable
and profitable, and who
work at logging out of
game season. Little Dismal
Swamp, though
smaller than its more
northern neighbor, is
very much more dense
with brush-wood, and decidedly
more forbidding,
because its gloomy depths
rarely echo with the
voice of man, or the
sound of the woodman’s
ax. Fifty years ago it was the refuge of runaway negroes, and a dangerous place for a white man to be seen, because the blacks who hid
in its thick coverts were usually of the most desperate character, who would not hesitate at crime. One of the best-remembered, because
the most tragic, negro insurrections that ever occurred in Virginia was headed by a Samsonian black named Nat Turner. Under his
leadership more than a hundred armed negroes rose against their masters and massacred a score of men, women and children. When a
sufficient force of whites was mustered to oppose them, the negroes fled to Little Dismal Swamp, where, after great length of time, they
were starved into surrender. Nat Turner, however, was last to submit to his pursuers, and committed so many crimes, while the search
for him continued, that his very name became a terror; but he was at last captured through betrayal by a negro whom he trusted, and after
due trial was convicted and hanged.</p>

<p>BONAVENTURE CEMETERY, SAVANNAH, GEORGIA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Our next halting place on the flight southward was Savannah, the Gate City, as it is the Queen City of the South. Next to Atlanta
in commercial importance, Savannah is easily first of all sunny metropoli in the superb beauty of its situation and the park grandeur of its
surroundings. Here it was that General Oglethorpe founded his Georgia colony early in 1733; and the flourishing city, from which the
first ocean steamer that ever attempted
to cross the Atlantic
sailed, and its rank as the second
cotton port of the United
States, are striking proofs of
his foresight and excellent discrimination.</p>

<p class='c011'>The city is situated on a
bold bluff overlooking the Savannah
River, along which it
extends in a curved front for a
distance of three miles, affording
excellent wharfage. The
streets are all very broad and
magnificently shaded, while
parks containing one to three
acres occur at all the principal
intersections, charmingly laid
out and beautified with flowers,
which grow in that warm climate
in the richest profusion.
Flower gardens constitute one
of the most characteristic features
of the place, for a majority
of the residences are surrounded
by ample grounds that are
abloom with flowering plants
throughout the year. This is
the borderland of southern evergreens,
where the stately oak is
festooned with pearl-gray mosses, and the orange and the magnolia fill the air with delicious perfumes. Along the streets, too, are rows of
flowering oleanders, pomegranates, palmettos, bananas, laurels, bays and sweet crape-myrtles. But of all the beauties about Savannah none
rival the charms of Bonaventure Cemetery, four miles from the city, on Warsaw River, and reached by a shell road that is equal to any
drive-way in the world. Every grave is a flower-bed, and the long avenues canopied with moss-garlanded oaks present a picture Arcadian
in its loveliness, and suggestive of those flowery glades through which immortals might delight to wander.</p>

<p>OLD CITY GATES, ST.

The old city was surrounded by a wall as security against attacks from the outside, and of this wall the gates, so beautifully photographed on this page, are about the only remaining relics. It is one of the links connecting the present with the earliest events of discovery in our country—a link rusty with the blood of conquest and martyrdom. Here it was that Spanish cruelty and French retaliation were carried to the most barbaric extreme, and cruelty is always in need of strong walls to protect it from the enemies it creates and nourishes.</span></p>

<p>A HOME IN THE MOUNTAINS OF GEORGIA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The country district about Savannah is somewhat similar in appearance to that of Western North Carolina, except that its mountains
are not nearly so high. The soil, however, is practically the same, as are the social conditions; and hence the constant reminder of that
section which we have already described. The old log-cabin is a familiar sight in Georgia, often vine-wreathed, and showing signs of
great antiquity, with roofs of clap-board, upon which the rain patters like the long-roll beat of a snare-drum. The picture which we present
is typical of this class, and an example as well of rural simplicity. Homely, battered by time, and affording few comforts, yet in such
cabins greatness has often had its birth, nor scorned such humble nativity. How many men of high estate lie down in the drapery of fine
linen and, when night has folded the earth in her sable arms, think of the old cabin home in Georgia; of the long time ago; of the bubbling
spring in the hollow and the gourd that hung by it; of the grape-vine swing, and the cows mooing in the pasture; of father and mother,
and the graves on the hillside.
And there is a sigh from the
heart. The old time was the
flush of life’s morning; it is
growing evening now, and the
shadows are creeping up the
slopes. Soon the present will
be the “old times” to our
children. How many men who
have achieved greatness would
exchange their possessions and
positions for youth and the old
cabin home as they see it now
in their dreams! Many, yes,
very many.</p>

<p class='c011'>Inseparable, almost, from
the log-house of the Southern
poor, is the cabin home of the
negro, because the two are
separated by such a thin line of
distinction that only critical inspection
can prevent them from
assimilating in the minds of
those unfamiliar with Southern
life. There is the same stone-chimney
and clap-board roof, but the colored man’s cabin is a single room, and the front is porchless. More hasty construction is also
noted, for the logs are laid like a turkey-pen, and clap-boards are used again, not for weather-boarding, but as a substitute for batten.
Windows are not needed, through which to exchange civilities with the season, for there are holes and crannies to let smoke out, and
plenty of accidental entrances for the warm summer air to get in. It is thus at small effort and no care the worst weather is kept out, and
contentedness reigns within.</p>

<p>AMONG THE PALMETTOS ON THE BANKS OF HALIFAX RIVER, FLORIDA.—<span class="multicaption">This is a typical Southern scene, and one of the most delightful to human senses that could be imagined. It is so perfectly in accord with nature that in imagination we can hear the bursting of the buds as they grow beneath the fructifying influences of the Southern sun, and feel the soft, hazy atmosphere as it gently rolls in from the cooling waters of the sea, and floods the intervening spaces of the moss-covered trees. In the Garden of Eden there must have been many bowers such as this, where Adam and Eve whispered the first vows of devotion and human love.</span></p>

<p>THE HEAD OF HALIFAX RIVER, ABOVE ORMOND.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Through Georgia and into the land of orange groves we sped, stopping a day at Jacksonville, and then hurried on to San Augustine,
the oldest town in America (founded by the Spanish in 1565), and possibly the most interesting. It is a link which connects the present
with the earliest events of discovery in our country—a link rusty with the blood of conquest and martyrdom. Here it was that Spanish
cruelty and French retaliation were carried to the most barbaric extreme, and the enslavement of native Indians began. Passing through
the first ordeals of settlement, a century later it was bitterly afflicted by raids of Indians and the plundering of pirates, so that its growth
was prevented, and not until the British surrendered possession to the United States in 1821, did the place show any indications of permanency,
or that it would attain to any importance beyond what it had before reached as a very small village.</p>

<p class='c011'>St. Augustine is located on a narrow peninsula formed by the Matanzas and San Sebastian Rivers, and is separated from the ocean
by Anastasia Island. From a place of little consequence, in the last few years it has become distinguished as the most popular winter resort
in the South. Several things have
conspired to bring about this
change, chief of which, however,
was the enterprises of Mr. H. M.
Flagler, who, recognizing its
favorable location, resolved to convert
the town from a listless, sleeping,
poverty-stricken village into
such an Eden of loveliness as the
arts of man can create. In accomplishing
this object he spent
$6,000,000, and the improvements
are of such a character as may well
satisfy his ambition. The Ponce
de Leon Hotel is a revival of the
richest examples of Moorish architecture.
It is old Spain of the
golden reign of Ibn-l-Ahmar transported
to American shores. And
strange coincidence it is, that the
year in which Columbus set sail on
his first western voyage in quest of
eastern lands, the year of the
Moorish Expulsion, the beautiful
Alhambra, most magnificent building
that ever graced the earth, was
given over to vandalism and
spoliation. The Ponce de Leon, with its lavish adornment, picturesque style and exquisite grounds, in which every known tropical plant
is made to add its beauty and shed its fragrance, while fountains cool the summer air, is a reminder of the great palace of Grenada, and
the chivalry of Spain in the time of Columbus.</p>

<p>AVENUE OF MOSS-COVERED OAKS, NEAR ORMOND, FLORIDA.—<span class="multicaption">Laying aside the question as to whether the command to work, that was imposed upon our first parents, was a curse or a blessing, it is easy to conceive that one reared among such scenery as this, where there are but few wants which the spontaneous growth of nature does not supply, would naturally regard hard labor as the greatest curse that could be pronounced against mankind. Here, side by side and of their own volition, grow the orange, the pomegranate, the fig, the melon, and nearly all the other fruits and vegetables necessary for the support of physical existence, while life is made delightful with the blossom and odor of thousands of bright-hued and ever-blossoming flowers. Here let us rest and dream, and think of work only when the flaming sword of necessity drives us forth to exertion.</span></p>

<p>PALMETTO HUTS NEAR TITUSVILLE, FLORIDA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>But the interest to St. Augustine visitors is not confined to the Ponce de Leon, glorious as it is, joined though it be to its almost
equally superb annexes, the Cordova and Alcazar, for the city is filled with the relics of an olden time, and associations that are almost
painful to recall. Along its water-front extends a sea wall one mile in length and ten feet broad, built of coquina and coped with granite,
forming an incomparable promenade between the old Franciscan monastery, now used as a barracks, and the ancient fort of San Marco,
now known as Fort Marion. Though not the most formidable, these antique fortifications rank all others of this country in interest. Their
construction was begun by Menendez de Aviles in 1565, at the time of the founding, but were not completed until two centuries later, all of
the work being performed by enslaved Indians. The fortifications cover about four acres, and the walls are of coquina, a conglomerate of
shells and sand brought from Anastasia Island, which, soft when dug, hardens by exposure. The fort is a splendid example of the best
military architecture of the time, being in the shape of a trapezium, surrounded by a wide and deep moat, and with walls twenty-one feet
high, sharp bastions at the corners, thick casemates, and subterranean passages and vaults which might serve equally for refuge ports or
dungeons. That some of these were used
for the latter purpose is proved by the fact
that in one of the least accessible dungeon-rooms,
the entrance to which was accidentally
found, two skeletons chained to
the wall were discovered. What a story
of suffering these might tell if they could
speak!</p>

<p class='c011'>In the earlier centuries a wall extended
across the peninsula, which protected the
city from attack on the north side, but
nothing now remains of this defence except
the old city gates, at the head of St. George
street. These are massive square towers
fifteen feet high, pierced with loop-holes,
and at the base of each is a sentry-box,
which the guards occupied when on duty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Near the center of the business part of
the city is the old slave-market, adjoining
which is the <i>Plaza de la Constitucion</i>, containing
a monument erected in 1812,
commemorative of the Spanish Liberal
Constitution, while another monument
stands in front of the old Market, which
was erected in 1879, in honor of the Confederate
dead.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides being a great winter resort, St. Augustine is a place of some commercial importance, its largest industry being the manufacture
of palmetto hats, while in the convents a fine quality of lace goods is made, by girls and the nuns in charge.</p>

<p>IN THE DEEP PALMETTO SOLITUDES ALONG INDIAN RIVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It is about seventy-five miles from St. Augustine to Ormond by the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railroad, one of the branches
of the Plant System, whose terminus is Daytona, five miles below Ormond. Indeed, nearly every road in Florida is the property of the
Plant company, which has proven a factor of incalculable benefit to the State, and has reaped correspondingly great reward. Ormond is located
on the head of Halifax River, which is a part of the Indian River Lagoon, connected by the Mosquito Haul-Over, or canal. We are now in
the sub-tropics, and among the paradisiac delights of a marvelous sun-browned land, where the mocking-bird opens the matin competition in
the college of vernal hymns, and the palmettos are vocal with the softly stirring breeze. The landscape is a dreamy haze of incomparable
loveliness, where a feast of flowers is perpetually spread, and the voice of peris may be heard down under the green waters of a murmuring
sea. Only a thin stretch of golden beach lies between the mainland, on which Ormond is located, and the ocean, so near that the billows
are distinctly heard beating against the shore. Along this water-front of lagoon and sea are gleaming sands so hard that step nor wheel
make any impression, and so inviting that nymphs might make it a playground. West of the village is a typical hummock of tropical
growths, penetrated by a glade that is embowered and sweetly shaded by massive oaks gracefully festooned with pearl-gray mosses, and
palmettos that flaunt their tangled, rustling branches before the beaming sun. Hereabout, too, are groves rich-laden with fruits as golden
as those that were plucked by
Hercules in the garden of Hesperides;
where the orange and
the banana bend beneath the
weight of their own deliciousness,
and pour out their honey
to the bees in rich extravagance.</p>

<p class='c011'>At Ormond boat was taken
for a trip down Indian River,
a journey which all the speech
of adjective and imagery cannot
justly describe. Indian River
and Halifax River are not
streams, but shallow lagoons,
strips of the ocean enclosed by
narrow tongues of sandy beach,
severed by occasional inlets
through which the billows break
tumultuously. Its extreme
length, for the two are now joined
by a canal, is about two hundred
miles, and though rarely more
than three feet deep, and in
places less, the lagoon is navigated
by a line of stern-wheel
boats, which, in winter-time,
are crowded with excursionists,
notwithstanding their sleeping accommodations are confined almost entirely to cots in the cabins. One line runs to Titusville, and there
connects with another, which carries passengers as far south as Jupiter, the southern limit of the river. In the last year (1892) a railroad
has been built from Titusville to Rockledge, and is being pushed southward, so that in another year or two the trip to Jupiter may be made
by rail. But the boat journey, though beset by some harassments, consequent upon narrow passages and low water, will lose little of its
popularity, because it will always remain one of the most delightful that can be taken. The connection between Halifax and Indian Rivers
is by means of a canal that requires constant dredging, and through which it is difficult to pass with boat when the wind is blowing hard;
while at times it is so choked
with sand that the boats have
to be literally dragged through
by means of hawser and capstan.
New Smyrna is a town of some
importance, as is Titusville, but
besides these, the landings are
of no consequence as trading-places,
consisting of never more
than one or two stores and as
many houses. This sparseness
of population increases the interest
of travelers on the river,
for the charm of primeval
beauty and attractiveness thus
remains.</p>

<p>LAKE OKEECHOBEE, FLORIDA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The river at Rockledge is nearly six miles wide and furnishes the finest sea for sailing, for the salt-air is present, and the dangers of
heavy billows are absent. Across this expanse lies a broad strip of land which is divided by another lagoon called Banana River, along
which is a charming vista of wood that has been named by some admirer Fairyland. This strip of forest-growth is beautiful enough to
justify the name, and wandering through groves of oranges, palms, magnolias and paw-paws, on shell-walks of snowy whiteness, fancy
pictures a troop of dryads picnicking
among the trees, and
drinking nectar from flaming
begonia flowers that sprinkle
the woods with scarlet. At
the lower end of Fairyland
is a natural park in which
gnarled oaks spread their giant
shadows over a lawn of grasses,
and on the margin is a grove of
pine-apples, the fragrance of
which almost stifles the odor
from the orange-blossoms. A
single cottage is the only
habitation in this poetic retreat,
before the door of which
are lofty paw-paws waving
their feathery crests, and a
gigantic rubber, or banyan
tree, whose branches woo the
soil and have taken root
therein. Only one other specimen
of this remarkable tree,
of equal size, is found in the
United States, and it, too, is
a native of Florida, being one
of the chief curiosities of Key West. There are other species that exhibit a disposition to fix the points of their drooping branches in the
ground, but it is peculiar to the banyan to send out shoots from its main stems, which, instead of growing upward, point straight down, and
even before reaching the ground the ends put out root-tendrils, which strike into the soil and firmly attach themselves as soon as they reach
the earth. As the boat proceeds southward from Rockledge the way grows in interest, for we soon reach what may be called “the region of
water-fowls.” Ducks, coots, water-hens, absolutely cover the river’s surface, while pelicans increase in number until we reach Pelican
Island, where they swarm by thousands. The rising of water-fowl before the boat is a wondrous sight, and the beating of their wings on
the water produces a sound like a heavy fall of hail on a dry clap-board roof; there are positively millions, and the commotion which they
create is almost pandemonium. Another remarkable sight which we witnessed was a school of porpoises that had strayed into the lagoon
(for they are not commonly found there) which, being frightened by the boat, made a retreat across the river in such precipitation that the
shallow water was beaten into foam, leaving a streak of white behind them that marked their course some time after.</p>

The broad green blades of the plants, the golden reddish yellow fruit, and the pleasant odor that fills the air form a combination of the most delightful character. No one can fully appreciate the delicious flavor of the pineapple until he has plucked it ripe from the plant and eaten it on the spot. The fruit that goes to market is cut when only half ripe, and thus loses the best part of its flavor, and is spongy and tough in comparison with that which is allowed to mature before being gathered.</span></p>

<p>A CAMP OF CONSUMPTIVES, NEAR LAKE WORTH, FLORIDA.</p>

<p class='c011'>The character of the shore vegetation also changed, the spiney-palmetto giving place to mangroves that grow so thickly a man
might almost walk on their tops. In these deep forests wild game is abundant, including deer, bear, panthers and ’coons; and on our journey
we saw a ’coon that had so little fear it scarcely moved even when the boat brushed the limb upon which it sat. When night falls upon
these solemnly somber deep woods a sense of dread steals on the traveler, though he be in a gay crowd on a good steamboat. The river
narrows for nearly ten miles
through the mangrove thickets,
and during this interval the
banks are within reach from
both sides. The passage is
tortuous, too, and the boat requires
slow and careful handling,
frequently the bow striking
one bank and the stern the
other, while the electric bull’s-eye
light penetrates and flashes
like a Druid’s fire dance in the
tangled copse where many slimy
and uncanny things have their
haunts. An alligator’s grunt,
a loon’s cry, a frog’s hoarse
croak, and a snake-bird’s piping
are some of the sounds that animate
the solitudes, and cracking
branches betray the proximity
of some wild beast whose
eyes are like lanterns in the
darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>After hours of patient working,
Jupiter Narrows are passed
and the boat speeds on, her
iron hull often grinding on the
oyster-beds, and long waves breaking over the shallows. Eden is then reached, and the odor of the pine-apple is perceptible in the air. A
stop is made to allow passengers to go on shore and visit the pine-apple grove near-by, where that excellent fruit is cultivated successfully
by a gentleman who first lost a fortune in the experiment. A mile below Eden St. Lucie Sound and River extend several miles inland
towards Lake Okeechobee, twenty-five miles distant. It is proposed to connect the lake with this river by means of a canal, and thus drain
the swamps and everglades of Southern Florida. Another shorter canal on the west would connect the lake with Caloosahat River, and
thus two outlets would be afforded, which would speedily accomplish the purpose of the company that has undertaken the enterprise.</p>

The latter, when it reaches the delicious yellow stage of full maturity, does its part in helping to dress the field in the most beautiful livery of nature, presenting a scene of gold, green and maroon surpassing the powers of pen or pencil to depict or portray.

<p>THE ONE-OX SHAY IN FLORIDA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Twenty-five miles below Eden is Jupiter, the southern termination of Indian River, a little town that derives its importance from the
Government light-house which stands before the inlet to warn vessels off the dangerous reefs outside. The surroundings, however, are
very delightful, especially the beach, which is strewn with the prettiest ocean-shells that ever a pensive person gathered, including an
occasional pearly nautilus, a perfect one of which we had the good fortune to find. Near-by is the Spouting Rock, a coquina formation that
rises into a bank and which has been hollowed at the base by incessant dashing of the billows. Into this grotto the waves plunge with such
force that they drive out through an opening in the top of the rock like a colossal fountain, and are scattered by the winds into a shower of
rainbows. A narrow-gauge railroad runs south from Jupiter, a distance of eight miles, to Juno, its terminus on Lake Worth, where tourists
take a steam launch for Palm
Beach and are then in the land
of the cocoanut. The voice of
eloquence grows coarse when it
attempts to paint the beauties
of this o’er fair summer-land;
a land where warm zephyrs stir
the hazy air with breath of perpetual
bloom, and sensuous
perfumes fan the cheeks of languorous
day. In this Arcadian
spot of beauty, where the air is
passionate as a lover, wooing
and kissing the flowers, tossing
and embracing the fronds of
the cocoa-trees, there is a joy
like retrospection; a communion
with the rapturous soul of
nature; a commingling with the
creatures of our sweetest fancy;
a balmy, delicious sense of gratification
that lulls and etherealizes;
that bridges the gulf
between the real and the ideal;
that builds substantial castles in
clouds of gold, and makes everything
a slave to our desires.
The banks are pictures of beauty, the gardens are beds of perennial delight. Lake Worth is separated from the ocean by a strip of land
less than half a mile wide, and this narrow tongue of what was once bare sand has been converted into a stretch of tropical exuberance.
For a distance of four miles there is an unbroken glade of cocoanut-trees, while nearer to the sea-shore are banana groves, and trees bending
to the ground with guavas, sapodillas, oranges, lemons and other tropical fruits. At intervals there are gardens full-bearing in February
with beans, peas, tomatoes, and along the walks are flower-beds that flame with color and lade the atmosphere with nature’s incense. To
walk through such a grove of fruitful delight is to fill the heart with ecstasy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The air of this southern region is not only languorous but, in the piney districts particularly, is balsamic, and hence thousands of
consumptives go to Florida for relief which they cannot find elsewhere. The Everglades are not what they were formerly pictured to be
before exploration revealed that instead of impenetrable swamps they are sections of very thickly timbered lands, whose only drawback
are spiney-palmettos, which render travel through them very laborious. But at several places I saw parties of consumptives encamped
not far from Indian River, and also in the vicinity of Lake Worth, where they spent their time in hunting and fishing, and claimed great
benefits from the exercise as well as from the restoratives contained in the air.</p>

nevertheless, characteristic, sluggish,
rather shallow and margined
with a thick growth of timber and
brush-wood. The landings, while
more important than those on
Indian River, are generally small
villages whose principal population
are negroes. The industries
in Florida are not varied as in
other States, but consist mainly of
fruit growing, fishing and phosphate
digging. Manufacturing
there is none, practically, and the
people derive their largest revenue
from tourists, who pay as much
for oranges, cocoanuts and pineapples
at the places where they
are grown as is charged for the
fruit in our Northern cities. Yet
there are signs of rapid growth in
Florida, and the State has a bright future, for it is settling up at a marvelous pace, and with an excellent class of immigrants.</p>

<p>AN ORANGE GROVE NEAR PALATKA, FLORIDA.—<span class="multicaption">A full-grown orange tree, loaded to the ground with its yellow, ripe, luscious fruit, is a delightful object to gaze upon. Oranges do not drop from the trees of their own accord as soon as they are matured, like most other fruits, but they hang by the stem until they are plucked off, and it is said that the longer they remain the sweeter and juicier do they become. Experience seems to prove the truth of this theory, for we have never eaten oranges elsewhere so deliciously sweet as when we took them from the tree with our own hands and ate them on the spot. Owing to the peculiarity of the fruit it is no uncommon thing to see ripe oranges on a tree that is in full bloom for another crop.</span></p>

<p>EXCURSION LAUNCH ON THE RUN, FLORIDA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>About Palatka are many very fine orange groves, and the city is in a flourishing condition, largely through the business of fruit
growing. In writing of the St. John’s River Mr. Edward King says, with truth well told: “The banks are low and flat, but bordered
with a wealth of foliage to be seen nowhere else upon this continent. One passes for hundreds of miles through a grand forest of cypresses
robed in moss and mistletoe; of palms towering gracefully far above the surrounding trees; of palmettos whose rich trunks gleam in the
sun; of swamp, white and black ash, of magnolia, water-oak, poplar and plane trees; and where the hummocks rise a few feet above the
water level, the sweet-bay, the olive, cotton-tree, juniper, red-cedar, sweet-gum, and live-oak shoot up their splendid stems; while among
the shrubbery and inferior growths one may note the azalea, the sumach, sensitive plant, agave, poppy, mallow, and the nettle. The fox-grape
clambers along the branches, and the woodbine and bignonia escalade the haughtiest forest monarch. When the steamer nears the
shore, one can see far through the tangled thickets the gleaming water, out of which rise thousands of cypress knees, looking exactly like
so many champagne bottles set into the current to cool. The heron and the crane saucily watch the shadow which the approaching boat
throws near their retreat. The wary monster-turtle gazes for an instant, with his black head cocked knowingly on one side, then disappears
with a gentle slide and splash. An alligator grins
familiarly as a dozen revolvers are pointed at him over the
boat’s side, sullenly winks with his tail, and vanishes, as the
bullets meant for his tough hide skim harmlessly over the
ripples left above him. For its whole length the river affords
glimpses of perfect beauty. It is not grandeur which one finds
on the banks of the great stream; it is nature run riot. The very
irregularity is delightful, the decay is charming, the solitude
is picturesque.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I may add to Mr. King’s description the regrettable fact
that the animate scenes which he pictured are no longer to be
witnessed on the St. John’s River. The persecution of alligators
by travelers on the steamers has resulted in the practical
extermination of those curious creatures in that stream. They
are now protected by a State law, but it came too late; where
alligators were plentiful five years ago they are now a curiosity,
though in some parts of Florida, where travel is not heavy,
their number is not yet diminished, but every year they are
becoming scarcer, and in a little while they will no doubt be
extinct. Not only are alligators persecuted for the mere sport
of killing, but thousands are annually destroyed by professional
hunters for their hides, which make an excellent leather. The
taxidermist also finds his business increased by the sale of
stuffed specimens to visitors from the North, while great numbers
of the young are caught and sold to the lovers of curious
things for pets, all of which contribute to their rapid diminution,
and their total extinction is therefore a matter of only a
short while.</p>

<p>A PALMETTO GLADE NEAR PALATKA, FLORIDA.—<span class="multicaption">The palmetto is intimately associated with the history of the South, having on several occasions been adopted as the national tree and emblazoned on the flags. It has also done good service on many occasions as material for forts and breastworks, the tough and spongy nature of the wood being well suited for such a purpose. No wonder, therefore, that it is regarded with a certain degree of love and veneration by the people who live within the limits of its growth. As a forest tree, or for the ornamentation of lawns, nothing could be more beautiful, as may be inferred from its elegant appearance in the photograph before us.</span></p>

<p>SILVER SPRING AND OCKLAWAHA STEAMBOAT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Palatka is a pretty town of 3,500 inhabitants, and situated in the heart of the orange belt. Besides its picturesque surroundings
and importance as a shipping point, it is healthfully located on high ground and in the midst of a piney region noted for the
blandness of its climate. Florida has been transformed within the past very few years by the Plant railways from a state of comparatively
sandy desolation, without roads through its dense growths, into a country of great advantages and thriftiness. Fruit trees have supplanted
the coverts of palmetto, and there is health and prosperity abounding everywhere. The “Florida Cracker,” as her languid, backwoods,
one-gallus type of slovenly, slow humanity is called, has not yet wholly disappeared, but the transition to more industrious and cultured
citizenship is going on, and it is particularly apparent about Palatka. The old-time conveyance of an ox in shafts hitched to a cart of
uncertain age is not quite obsolete, but it survives more as a relic than as a thing of every-day service; and people who visit Florida on
a winter trip, people in fine linen who are able to fare sumptuously, are more given to using the ox-cart, than are the permanent inhabitants.
In the mountain districts of Colorado tourists ride burros; in Florida they affect a preference for the harnessed ox. It is the
influence of locality that diversifies custom. Another curiosity in Florida, peculiar alike to Cuba and the tropics generally, is the palmetto
hut, an unsubstantial structure
roofed and “weather-boarded”
with palmetto leaves, but which
furnishes protection from the
sun and rain. These huts are
usually built to serve as temporary
abodes for orange-pickers,
and are therefore usually within
or near the groves. Throughout
Florida it is the custom to
sell the orange crop on the trees,
the purchasers being fruit
dealers from the North. These
dealers employ trained pickers,
who work throughout the season,
going from one grove to
another, until the gathering is
completed; usually they provide
their own supplies, likewise
their shelter, and the
palmetto hut serves them both
well and economically. When
the fleas become so thick as to
crowd the occupants, they burn
the hut and build another. It
is the cheapest way yet discovered
of getting rid of these elusive
pests.</p>

<p>SCENE ON THE SUWANEE RIVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>At Palatka we took boat
for an excursion up the Ocklawaha
River to Silver Spring and Ocala, the head of navigation on that stream. Of our many trips in the East, West and South, this
proved to be the most unique, the most wonderful, the most sensationally picturesque. Ocklawaha River is at once a lagoon, a narrow
lake, and a swamp, but at no place does it have the appearance of a flowing stream, for the current is scarcely perceptible. The shore-line
is indicated by a profuse growth of water-vegetation and cypress knees, while at places the river is so narrow that lofty trees interlace their
branches above the low smoke-stack of the boat. And what a boat! It is well adapted to the trade, and to that end is unlike any other
steamer that ever sat in the water, a thing of indescribable shape, an object of surprise and curiosity. On this queer craft fifty people may
ride in comfort during the day, while attention is attracted by the alligators, cranes, loons and snake-birds along the shore, but the night must
be spent in vain regrets and fighting mosquitoes. No chance to get lonesome on this trip; there is too much to see in day-time and too much
to do at night. But it is a novelty, an experience, a sensation worth more than the discomforts that must be endured. Along the Ocklawaha
alligators are still plentiful, because shooting is not allowed from the boat, and there is no other way to approach them within gun-shot
distance. The lazy monsters may be seen sunning their corrugated backs on nearly every log, and in their company huge water-snakes are
often found, associated with big and little snapping-turtles, the three species forming a congenial but most repulsive family of reptilian
cousinship. The water being
half-stagnant is black with a
vegetable dissolution, and yet
so transparent that the bottom
may at times be seen. But if
the creatures that haunt the
river are offensive, the sight is
compensated by the wonder
which they excite; while the
dense woods that margin the
shore are resonant with the
carol of birds and jewelled with
their brilliant plumage.</p>

<p class='c011'>The trip is remarkably interesting,
but the greatest
charm that attaches to the
stream is found when the boat
reaches Silver Spring, the most
exquisite pool that was ever
rippled by dip of oar or
skimmed by lap-wing. Tradition
tells us that this is the
marvelous rejuvenating spring
of which Ponce de Leon heard
fabulous tales which lured him
to the dark interior of Indian-infested
Florida. If his eyes
ever gazed into its crystalline depths surely he must have believed that his quest for the magic fountain had been rewarded. The clearness
of the water may be likened to the air itself, for at its greatest depth of eighty feet objects on the bottom may be clearly and distinctly seen,
likewise the fissure through which the water pours up like a veritable fountain. A peculiarity of the spring is the prismatic colors which
are reflected from any white or shiny object thrown into it. To test this curious fact I cast in a piece of broken crockery and watched with
keenest interest the fragment as it sank in a zigzag motion to the bottom. No rainbow was ever so brilliant as the colors which flashed
up from this piece of saucer, nor did ever jewel gleam with more scintillant beauty.</p>

<p>A HOME IN THE SHADES OF SOUTHERN PINES.—<span class="multicaption">If Ponce de Leon and his doughty Spaniards had remained in Florida and built them homes like this, under the shades of the health-giving pines, instead of wading through swamps and morasses in quest of the fountain of youth, they might, and probably would, have lived to be hale and hearty old men. Abodes like this, in the balmy air of the Sunny South, are fountains of life within themselves, where, free from worry and the necessity of making a living, one has but little to do aside from living and growing and being happy. Such homes, with contentment, are more worthy of being sought after than the wealth of a thousand Crœsuses.</span></p>

<p>A BAPTIZING ON THE SUWANEE RIVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The flow from Silver Spring is so great that a deep river one hundred feet wide is formed, which, after a course of nine miles, joins
the Ocklawaha. This stream is called the Run, and a little launch, or tug, plies over this short course, carrying visitors on an excursion
which, if brief, is incomparably delightful. Five miles from Silver Spring is Ocala, on the Florida Southern Railroad, to which point we
proceeded, and thence north and west by the Savannah, Florida and Western, and the Florida Central and Peninsular railroads to New
Orleans. Ocala is on the border or north limit of the hummock lands, and thereafter the journey was through pine-barrens which are so infested
with dwarf palmetto that it appears to be an impossible labor to clear it away. This is the home of the deer and likewise of the rattlesnake,
very monsters of the latter being more plentiful than game; but north of Gainesville the country presents a change for the better, being
much higher and undulating,
with hills that are 300 or 400
feet above the ocean level, and
the soil is exceedingly fertile.
The vegetation, too, loses its
tropical character, orange
groves disappear, and fields of
tobacco and cotton occupy the
landscape.</p>

<p class='c011'>At High Springs we crossed
the Santa River, a tributary of
the Suwanee; at New Bradford
we touched the banks of
that historic river, and at Ellaville
crossed the stream and
halted there a day to pay to it
the tribute of a respect aroused
in every American heart by
Foster’s mournful pastorale,
“The Old Folks at Home.”
Who has not heard “Way down
upon the Suwanee River”?
and who hearing the song has
not tried to picture the desolate
plantation and the dreary heart
that went up and down the
solitudes of the deserted cotton-field
sighing for the old massa and missus, who will never call for Pompey again? In a small boat we rowed down the river, which was
as still as death, and almost as motionless. The faint sound of a saw-mill at Ellaville was the only thing that gave reminder of our
proximity to civilization; and when at length even this link was broken by distance, it seemed as if all creation had gone into mourning.
The spell, while mournful, was yet dreamily charming, and instinctively, under the influence of such lonesome isolation, we sang with the
fullness of appreciation, “The Old Folks at Home.” Never before had song such sweetness, never had one so much of sadness, to me;
and when the last note died away there was a feeling of oppression in the silence that ensued. The old song brought up visions to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>we were unused: a fallow-field where once was bounty; a large white mansion with its long porch fallen in decay; a magnolia-tree with a
mocking-bird’s deserted nest ready to fall from its dead branches; two grave-stones, green with moss, in the pasture, and an old darkey
bowed in prayer. The Suwanee has its source in Okefenokee Swamps, Georgia, and after running its course of nearly three hundred miles,
empties into the Gulf of Mexico, just above Cedar Key. At some places the river has considerable width, but never sufficient depth to permit
of navigation by any craft of considerable size. Its banks are occasionally high, as at Ellaville, but generally they are flat and overhung
by oaks thickly festooned with moss. The current is sluggish and the water seldom clear, carrying as it does a thick vegetable solution.
The stream is neither beautiful nor romantic, save as it acquires the reputation for being both through the song that has made it as famous
as our largest rivers.</p>

<p>A SECTION OF BIENVILLE PARK, MOBILE, ALABAMA.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The country about Ellaville
is fairly well settled,
though the place itself hardly
ranks as a hamlet. We arrived
on Saturday, and as no trains
run on Sunday we were compelled
to remain over, and attended
church in the forenoon
and witnessed a baptizing later
in the day. The administration
of the ceremony proved to
be a great event in the unruffled
lives of the people, and
many came long distances to
witness the immersion of four
candidates, three women and a
man. The sight of a baptizing,
while common enough, possessed
for us unusual interest
because the place was Suwanee
River, and having the consent
of the officiating minister,
we took a photograph of the
crowd on shore, a heavy cloud
overcasting the sun immediately
after, so that a picture
could not be made of the baptizing. From Ellaville our journey was continued westward through Tallahassee and on to Mobile, where
a short stop was made, and thence to New Orleans. Mobile is not only one of the oldest towns in the South, but is among the earliest
settlements in America, the exact date of its founding being in dispute. The place is known to have been the original seat of the French
colonization in the Southwest as early as 1702, but its growth was so slow that the Colonial Government was transferred to New Orleans in
1723, and with the change, the little importance which it had acquired became lost, nor was it again recovered until the place became a
rendezvous for corsairs under the infamous Lafitte, from 1810 to 1815. Its greatest prosperity, however, dates since the civil war, though some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>years preceding that troublous period Mobile had become a considerable port, her chief shipments being cotton, coal, lumber and naval stores.</p>

<p>AVENUE OF TOMBS IN WASHINGTON CEMETERY, NEW ORLEANS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The entrance to Mobile Bay is commanded by Forts Morgan and Gaines, which are thirty miles below the city, and on the east side
of Tensas River are the ruins of Spanish Fort and Fort Blakely, all of which played an important part in the defence of the city when it
was attacked by Admiral Farragut, in August, 1864. One of the most desperate battles that was fought during the war took place in the
harbor, when Farragut ran the blockade with a squadron of ten powerful men-of-war headed by his flagship, the <i>Hartford</i>, and encountered
the Confederate fleet inside. One of the
Union ships ran onto a torpedo and was
instantly blown into fragments, but the other
vessels met with little opposition until at the
moment when Farragut thought the battle
won, he saw with surprise the dark body of
a strange vessel flying the Confederate flag
and bearing down upon him at great speed,
evidently intent upon ramming and sinking
his ship. The <i>Hartford</i>, by a piece of good
luck and skilful handling, managed to avoid
the intended blow, and then followed an
engagement that has few parallels in fierceness.
The strange gun-boat proved to be
the <i>Tennessee</i>, one of the most powerful and
destructive that the Confederate Government
had sent into service. The Union iron-clads
closed around their black and terrible antagonist
and battered her with their heavy prows
of steel until the unequal contest was ended
by her surrender. Forts Gaines and Morgan
were also captured, but Spanish Fort and
Fort Blakely still defended the city, which resisted
all efforts at its reduction until April 12,
1865, three days after the surrender of Lee.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mobile has grown greatly since the war,
and now has a population of nearly 35,000.
It is situated on a sandy plain that rises into
high and very graceful hills. Notwithstanding
the barren shore as nature made it, the
arts of man have supplied the deficiency of
soil and made of the streets bowers of lovely shade, so charming that much of the city’s fame is due to the noble trees that arch all its
streets. Bienville Park is one of the prettiest spots in southern lands, noted far and near alike for its massive live-oaks, magnificent
magnolias, and handsome fountain, a place swathed in delicious airs and luxurious with the richest and most beautiful vegetation.</p>

<p>A PLANTATION HOME IN MISSISSIPPI.—<span class="multicaption">This is one of the few old-time Southern mansions that survived the shock of war and still remain as landmarks of the golden age of the South country, when the wealthy planters owned armies of slaves and entertained with a hospitality even more than princely. As a rule these mansions have fallen into decay, even where they were not wholly or partially destroyed, for when the master and his sons left their bones to bleach upon some distant battle-field, the light of the home went out, and the weaker members of the household, reduced in many instances to pinching poverty, sadly but bravely took up the battle of life in less favored localities. But prosperity promises once more to smile upon the South, and the old mansions are being rebuilt, but the old faces are no more seen beneath their roofs.</span></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>Westward from Mobile the route was by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad along the Gulf border of Mississippi, through some of
the loveliest intervales that vision ever wandered over. The air is warm without debilitating sultriness, for the Gulf of Mexico tempers the
atmosphere with refreshing humidity, and a constant breeze shakes the perfume out of flowering shrub and tree. Many beautiful places
are passed on the run of one hundred and forty miles from Mobile to New Orleans, some of which are more or less noted as winter resorts,
such as Ocean Springs, Biloxi, Beauvoir, Pass Christian, and Bay St. Louis. Beauvoir has a place in history as being the residence of
Jefferson Davis for several years after the war, and where he died. The way is beautified also by many palatial homes and well-cultivated
plantations that attest the thrift and prosperity of farmers of the New South.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between Pass Christian and Bay St. Louis the road crosses an inlet of St. Louis Bay on a steel trestle, and a few miles further west
passes over Pearl River and enters Louisiana. The land is level, and cut up by innumerable bayous, and after crossing the narrow outlet
of Lake Pontchartrain, called Pigolet’s, the road runs along a tongue of sea marsh for a few miles, then plunges into a dismal swamp, where
the alligator’s bellow and the cormorant’s cry are the only sounds that disturb its stillness, save when a train goes growling by. “The sea
marsh is dotted with many lakes, where green vegetable rafts of lotus leaves and lily pods turn slowly with the tide or float lazily about,
blown by the breath of a salt breeze sweeping in from the Gulf. But in the ghostly gloom of the swamp, the forest trees are like an
assemblage of monstrosities, great gnarled trunks and knotted arms of moss-draped oaks, clutching at the fan-shaped fronds of palmettos,
while the mixture of crooked bodies and twisted leaf-stems of the latonia appear as if they were the bodies and outstretched arms of horned
goblins appealing for release.”</p>

<p class='c011'>New Orleans is a very old city, settled by the French in 1718. Like other settlements of these early times, it has passed through
many evil vicissitudes and been in turn a possession of France, Spain, and the United States. A singular thing in connection with the
city is the fact that it is built upon ground that is considerably lower than the surface of the Mississippi during high water, and that it has
no more substantial foundation than an alluvium deposit which has been going on for centuries, constantly extending into the Gulf, the
point of outlet of the Mississippi. To prevent overflowing, the city is protected by a dyke, or levee, which is fifteen feet wide and fourteen
feet high. This earth-wall follows the river’s crescent winding a distance of ten miles, while another extends across the rear to protect the
city from Lake Pontchartrain. To secure a firm foundation for some of the large buildings, cotton-bales have been used on which to build,
as piling is of no service. But that this character of basis is no disadvantage is proven by the fact that New Orleans is noted for its mammoth
edifices, public, church and commercial, which give no sign of insecurity. The place is essentially cosmopolitan, for in no other city is the
population more mixed, nearly every street being occupied by a different nationality. Commercially it is next to New York as an export
city, and easily holds the honor of the leading cotton port of the country, from which one-fourth of the world’s supply is floated. She is likewise
a city of many charms and great historic interest. Within the city proper occurred a terrible scene following the rebellion of 1763,
when France ceded the place to Spain, while at its southern outskirts is the battle-field on which Jackson won his glorious victory over the
British under Packenham, January 8, 1815. The city passed through another storm of shot and shell in 1862, when Farragut compelled
its capitulation after a terrible bombardment. But these scars have long since healed, and New Orleans, despite plagues and wars, has held
her position as Queen City of the South and one of the great metropoli of America, with a population now of 250,000, which is rapidly
increasing. While New Orleans is famous for the romance with which her history is invested, for her immense importance as an export
city, and also for the beauty of her parks and magnificence of her private residences, the curiosity of strangers is no less attracted by her
cemeteries, which are unlike those of any others in the world. In earlier times it was the custom there to bury the dead in shallow graves,
but this practice was finally abandoned for the more sacred and sanitary one of enclosing the bodies in tombs above the ground, and then
hermetically sealing up the mortuary cell. This became a necessity because of the nature of the soil, where water is reached at a depth
of two feet below the surface. Some of these tombs are mausoleums made of stone or iron and of beautiful architectural designs, but the
more common form of disposition of the dead is in a wall pierced by cells large enough to contain a coffin, one above the other, to a height
of seven or eight feet. There are thirty-three such cemeteries in New Orleans, in one of which (Greenwood) is a monument to the
Confederate dead; and in another, the National, at Chalmette, the Union dead are similarly honored.</p>

Two avenues, each a mile long, are adorned by myriads of gypsum rosettes and curiously twisted crystals, called “oulopholites,” or cave-flowers, which are unfolded by pressure like a sheaf of wheat forced through a tight binding.

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>Having completed our work in New Orleans, and a tour of the Southeast, or at least that portion which is noted for its semi-tropical
characteristics and great picturesqueness, we took train on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad for Mammoth Cave, to make an inspection
and photographic tour of that world-wonderful natural curiosity. To reach the Cave our route was northeast through Birmingham,
Nashville, and thence to Glasgow Junction, at which point connection is made with a little spur of the Louisville and Nashville Road, which
runs directly to the Cave, a distance of twelve miles from the Junction. Mammoth Cave is in the eastern part of Edmondson county,
Kentucky, eighty-five miles south of Louisville, and its entrance is in a forest ravine nearly two hundred feet above Green River, where
the banks are very steep and high. It is said to have been discovered in 1809 by a hunter named Hutchins, while pursuing a wounded
bear that had taken refuge in a wide crevice that led directly into a broad chamber of the Cave. The history of this discovery is not
sufficiently definite to enable us to know which one of the two points of entrance was thus accidentally found. The present opening used
is in the ravine mentioned, but the original mouth is believed to have been the aperture that is nearly a quarter of a mile above, and leads
into what is known as Dixon’s Cave, a disconnected branch of Mammoth Cavern.</p>

<p class='c011'>Luray Caverns are lighted by electricity, so that photographing its many chambers and beautiful stalactitic formations is easily
accomplished; but though Mammoth Cave is the largest and best known of the world’s great subterranean recesses, and visited by about
6,000 persons annually, no provision has been made for lighting, beyond the crude method of guides who carry torches and candles. To
photograph its dark rivers, avenues, configurations, and strange sculpturings many attempts have been made by the aid of magnesium
lights, but without satisfactory results until Mr. Ben. Hains, of New Albany, Indiana, made special and most careful preparations to do
the work which had so often failed in the hands of others. Several weeks were spent in the cave testing the powerful artificial lights
which he had provided, and by dint of perseverance he was at last rewarded by the most perfect results. To this enterprising gentleman
we are indebted for the use of the photographs from which our reproductions are made.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mammoth Cave first came into notice and importance about the year 1812, when it was discovered that the cave contained vast beds
of niter, sufficient, as was stated at the time, to supply the whole population of the globe with saltpeter. Gratz and Williams were the
owners, and established a very large industry in collecting the nitrous earth by means of ox-carts and shipping it to Philadelphia, where it
was used in manufacturing the gun-powder that enabled us to triumph over England a second time. The region is essentially cavernous,
as Professor Shaler estimates that in this carboniferous limestone district of Kentucky “there are at least 100,000 miles of open caverns,”
but very few of the five hundred caves and grottoes of Edmondson county contain nitrous earth. On the other hand, there have been very
few evidences of prehistoric occupancy discovered in Mammoth Cave, while in Salt Cave, its neighbor, and almost a rival in size, archæologic
remains, such as fire-places, burnt torches, sandals, and moccasin-prints are numerous; and in Short Cave, also near-by, the mummified
bodies of several small animals and a few human remains have been found. White Cave is half a mile from the Mammoth Cave entrance,
and the two may be connected, though the communication has not been discovered. But there is a decided difference in the formations that
characterize the two. White Cave is in some respects similar to Luray Caverns in its exquisitely charming variety of stalactites. In the
first chamber, “Little Bat Room,” as it is called, we find many lovely creations and a few objects of great interest to paleontologists. In
the second room is a piece of stalactitic drapery, which has been very appropriately called the “Frozen Cascade.” “Humboldt’s Pillar”
and “Bishop’s Dome” are other wonderful examples of the effects of slowly percolating water bearing lime in solution. In this same cave,
some seventy years ago, were found huge fossil bones, of the megalonyx, or giant sloth, bear, bison, and stag, and scattered among these
animal remains were a few human bones.</p>

<p class='c011'>But while the adjacent caves each possess an interest peculiar to themselves, Mammoth Cave must continue to remain the most
remarkable cavern in our country, not only for its size, but likewise for the marvels which exploration of its labyrinthine avenues has
revealed. To Professor H. C. Hovey’s admirable and scientific description of the Cave I acknowledge my indebtedness for a larger part of
the information here imparted, from which, also, liberal extracts are made, though without quotation credit.</p>

<p>OLD STONE HOUSE, MAMMOTH CAVE.—<span class="multicaption">The dry atmospheric condition of the galleries of Mammoth Cave led to a belief some forty years ago that a continuous residence within these dark precincts for a definite period would be beneficial to consumptives. The experiment was therefore made by building a number of stone houses or huts at a point about a mile within the cave, in which a colony of invalids took up their abodes and lived in deep seclusion until it was demonstrated by the death of several of the sufferers that they derived no benefit from the surroundings. Relics of two of these stone huts still remain, but they exist now only as curiosities, no one having spent a night in either of them for many years.</span></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>The entrance to Mammoth Cave is arched by a rock-span of seventy feet, thence leading by an easy descent down a winding flight
of stone steps to a narrow passage through which the air rushes outward with great force in summer and is drawn inward with corresponding
violence during the winter, a phenomenon due to the inequality of temperature between the air inside and out of the Cave, for the temperature
of the Cave is uniformly 54° Fahrenheit at all times. The atmosphere being thus constantly agitated, is kept constantly pure, for
while the lower levels are moist, being no doubt connected with Green River, the upper avenues and galleries are always dry; conditions
which were one time thought to be particularly favorable to consumptives, as well as to those suffering from other wasting diseases. The
experiment was therefore made, some forty years ago, of building thirteen stone houses at a point one mile within the Cave, in which a
number of invalids took up their domicile and lived there in deep seclusion until it was demonstrated that whatever might be the salubrity
of the atmosphere, consumptives derived no benefit from it, a number dying in the Cave. Relics of two of these stone huts still remain,
but they exist now only as curiosities, no one having spent a night in one of them for many years.</p>

<p class='c011'>The main cave is from 40 to 300 feet wide and from 35 to 125 feet high, divided into a great number of rooms and winding avenues,
the extent of which has not yet been determined, for exploration of the Cave is far from being complete. Some of the best known rooms
are, first, the Rotunda, in which are ruins of the old saltpeter works, and where the skeletons of two men were found several years ago.
Beyond this is the Star Chamber, where the protrusion of white crystals through a coating of black oxide of manganese creates an optical
illusion of great beauty. Another department is called the Chief City, a chamber of nearly two acres space, with a vaulted roof 125 feet
high. The floor is bestrewn with rocks, among which have been found charred torches of cone, and a few other evidences of prehistoric
occupancy. There are also shown some mummified bodies, preserved by their inhumation in nitrous earth, utensils, ornaments, braided
sandals, and other relics, but all of these were found in Salt and Short Caves, near-by, and removed to Mammoth Cave for exhibition. The
main cave ends four miles from the entrance, but is joined to other spacious chambers by winding passages leading to different levels, so
that while the cavern area is perhaps less than ten miles, the total length of the avenues is supposed to be 150 miles.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chief places of interest are found along two main lines of the explored portions, from which side excursions may be made.
The “short route” may be covered in about four hours, but it requires nine hours to traverse what is known as the “long route.”
Audubon Avenue is the first leadway, interesting for the swarms of bats that hang in huge clusters from the ceiling, but it is not until
Gothic Avenue is reached that stalactites and stalagmites are met with. This passage leads into the Chapel, at the end of which is a beautiful
double dome and cascade; thence we pass into the Throne-Room, with its royal formations of surprising splendors, which compel visitors
to stop, and elicit exclamations of wonder and admiration. The Bridal Altar is almost equally grand, with its frosted pillars of pearl-white,
and the convolutions of their magnificent pediments that may be likened to clouds in the sky of cave. Indeed, these vertical shafts or
petrified columns are among the most surprising features of cave scenery. They are not confined to the Bridal Altar, however, for they
pierce through all levels, from the uppermost galleries to the lowest floors, and even find lodgment in the sink-holes.</p>

<p class='c011'>A block of stone that is forty feet long by twenty feet wide is called the Giant’s Coffin, and when viewed from a certain angle the
resemblance to a funeral casket is so great that even if attention were not called to it, visitors would hardly fail to be a little shocked by
the sight. There is a narrow passage-way around the coffin, which followed leads to a large vault called Gorin’s Dome, in which there are
six pits varying in depth from 65 to 220 feet; truly, awful pits to fall into. Notwithstanding the treacherous character of the floor, Gorin’s
Dome is one of the finest chambers in the Cave, for it is charmingly festooned and pillared with stalactitic formations. Mammoth Dome,
which is at the termination of Sparks Avenue, is probably more interesting, because besides having its walls draped with a marvelous
tapestry, the great wonder of the room is immensely increased and beautified by a cataract, which falls from a height of 250 feet and fills
the apartment with its musical splashings. The Egyptian Temple, which is a continuation of the Mammoth Dome, contains six massive
columns, two of which are quite perfect and eighty feet high by twenty-five feet in diameter. Lucy’s Dome, which is three hundred feet
high, is the loftiest of these monster shafts, the equal of which cannot be found in any known cave in the world.</p>

<p>BEAUTIFUL BOW VALLEY.—<span class="multicaption">One of the peculiarly attractive and picturesquely exquisite portions of British America is mountain-begirted Bow Valley, 500 miles east of Vancouver, along the Canadian Pacific Railway line. The region is wondrously diversified and marvelously beautiful, holding within its compass not only a valley of paradisaic charms, but also mountains of startling grandeur, with crystalline lakes reposing on their bosoms, range breaking beyond range, snowy crests gleaming with sunlight splendors, forests tinted with softest hues, streams that murmur and cascades that roar, while the valley is aflame with the richest colorings of daisies, buttercups, bluebells, heather, wild pinks, anemones, and brianthus, a symphony of beauty, a colossal bouquet decorating the marriage-bed of nature.</span></p>

<p>GIANT’S COFFIN, MAMMOTH CAVE, KENTUCKY.—<span class="multicaption">This remarkable and weird curiosity is composed of a huge block of stone forty feet long by twenty wide, and when viewed from a certain angle the resemblance to a funeral casket is so great that, even if attention were not called to it, visitors would hardly fail to be a little shocked by the uncanny sight. Standing within its presence it is almost impossible to divest one’s self of the belief that he is gazing upon the last resting-place of some tremendous giant, the guardian genius, perhaps, of this lugubrious subterranean abode; and it is with a sigh of relief that we pass on to more inspiring and splendid scenery.</span></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>The Maelstrom, in Croghan’s Hall, is one of the deepest and most awful-appearing pits yet discovered, and until 1859 no one had
ever ventured to explore its dark recesses. It is at a remote point in the Cave and seldom visited, because the way is beset with obstacles,
while the sight is neither reassuring nor compensating. A son of George D. Prentice, however, braved the dangers of the pit by permitting
some of his friends to lower him 190 feet by a rope to the bottom, but his experience was of little value, because he found nothing of
interest to reward him for the trouble. Some pretty stalactites are near this pit, and also in Fairy Grotto, but in the deeper recesses there
is a remarkable absence of these formations. Indeed, considering the character and extent of Mammoth Cave, its poverty of stalactitic
ornamentation is surprising. On the other hand, it contains an unexampled wealth of crystals of endless variety and incomparable beauty.
Besides the sparkling vault of the Star Chamber, which is 300 feet long and 80 feet high, there are halls canopied by fleecy clouds, or
studded by mimic snow-balls, and others displaying various grotesque resemblances on the walls and ceilings. Cleveland’s Cabinet, and
Marion’s Avenue, each a mile long, are adorned by myriads of gypsum rosettes and curiously twisted crystals called “oulopholites.” These
cave-flowers are unfolded by pressure, like a sheaf of wheat forced through a tight binding. This charming embellishment of clusters and
garlands is frequently seen curling outward, like roses, composing petrified bouquets that cover the snowy arches.</p>

<p class='c011'>This curious feature is even more marked by the stalactites in Mary’s Vineyard, where they appear in the form of an aggregation of
spherical prominences, resembling clusters of grapes. Other chambers are drifted with snowy crystals of sulphate of magnesia, and the
ceilings are so thickly covered with their efflorescence that a sharp concussion of the air will cause them to fall like flakes in a snow-storm.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many small rooms and tortuous paths, where danger lies, are avoided as much as possible; but even on the regular routes through the
Cave some disagreeable experiences are inevitable, while about the deep pits peril is always present. The one now known as the Bottomless
Pit was for many years a barrier to all further exploration, and until a substantial wooden bridge was built across it. Long before the
shaft had been cut as deep as now, the water flowed away by a channel gradually contracting until at a point called The Fat Man’s Misery
the walls were only eighteen inches apart. The rocky sides are beautifully marked with waves and ripples, as if running water had been
suddenly petrified. This winding-way conducts to River Hall, beyond which lie the crystalline gardens that have been described. It was
formerly believed that if this narrow passage were closed, escape would be impossible; but a few years ago a tortuous fissure called the
Cork-Screw was discovered, by means of which a good climber ascending a few hundred feet finally lands 1,000 yards from the mouth of
the Cave, and cuts off nearly two miles.</p>

<p class='c011'>The waters, entering through numerous domes and pits, and falling, during the rainy season, in cascades of great volume, are finally
collected in River Hall, where they form several extensive lakes, or rivers, whose connection with Green River is known to be in two deep
springs appearing under arches on its margin. Whenever there is a freshet in Green River the streams in the cave are joined in a
continuous body of water, the rise sometimes being as much as sixty feet above the low-water mark. The subsidence within is less rapid
than the rise; and the streams are impassable during a greater part of the year. They are usually navigable from May to October, and
furnish exceedingly interesting as well as novel features of cave scenery. The largest body of water is called the Dead Sea, embraced
within a basin formed by cliffs sixty feet high, above which a path has been made which leads to a stairway and thence to the River Styx,
a body of water that is four hundred feet long and forty feet wide. Lake Lethe is the next water-basin, enclosed by walls ninety feet high,
below which is a path that conducts to a pontoon at the neck of the lake. Thence a beach of the finest yellow sand extends for 500 yards
to Echo River, the largest of all, being nearly one mile long, from 20 to 200 feet broad, and varying in depth from 10 to 40 feet. Two or
three boats are placed on this Lethean or Stygian stream, in which visitors are taken from one end of the river to the other, and the trip
is of such novelty that the remembrance of it is imperishable. To see the boats approaching, in the weird light of flickering torches, is
like a vision of a spectral crew, funereal, sepulchral and almost horrific. The arch overhead is symmetrical but irregular in height, and is
famous for its musical reverberations—not a distinct echo, for the repetitions are so rapid that they merge and become a prolongation of
sound that continues for nearly half a minute. The long vault has a certain key-note of its own, which, when sounded, produces harmonies
of almost incredible depth and sweetness.</p>

<p>THE BRIDAL ALTAR, MAMMOTH CAVE.—<span class="multicaption">The Bridal Altar is one of the most magnificent spectacles of Mammoth Cave, with its frosted pillars of pearl-white and the convolutions of their magnificent pediments that may be likened to clouds in the sky of the cave. These vertical shafts or petrified columns are among the most surprising and beautiful features of cave scenery, and when brilliantly lighted they present a scene of splendor surpassing the utmost stretch of the imagination.

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>In these Plutonian regions of perpetual night, where vegetation is only imaged by petrified efflorescence, many creatures find a
congenial abode, and become so accustomed to this dark habitat that they cannot live elsewhere. Of the twenty-eight different species
here found, the most remarkable are a blind and wingless grasshopper with extremely long antennae; a blind and colorless cray-fish, and a
blind fish which grows to the length of six inches. These fish possess the additional curiosity of being viviparous, or producing their
young in a living state, instead of by eggs. Occasionally other fish are caught in the running streams of the Cave which are identical with
species common in Green River, thus proving the subterranean connection that exists between that river and the Cave streams.</p>

<p class='c011'>The strongly marked divergence of these blind creatures from those found on the outside led Agassiz to believe that they were
specially created for the limits within which they dwell; but the opinion now generally held is that they are modifications of allied species
existing in the sunlight, and that their peculiarities are to be accounted for on the principles of evolution—the process of change being
accelerated, or retarded, by their migration from the outer world to a region of silence and perpetual darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having concluded our examination of Mammoth Cave, we departed by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad for Louisville, at
which city train was taken on the St. Louis Air Line for Wyandotte Cave, which was to be our last objective point in completing our
extensive photographic tour of America. This very remarkable Cave, though not so generally known as Luray or Mammoth, is about ten
miles south of the Louisville and St. Louis Air Line, in Crawford county, Indiana, and is only five miles from the Ohio River. We reached
the Cave by way of Milltown, thence to Corydon, and from that point by private conveyance a distance of eleven miles. Entrance to the
Cave is by way of a large opening in a hillside, the aperture being about six feet high and twenty feet wide, through which there is
always a strong circulation of air like that noted at the mouth of Mammoth Cave, while the temperature is likewise uniformly 54°
Fahrenheit. A short avenue leads into a chamber known as Fanueil Hall, whose dimensions are 200 feet long, 50 feet wide and 25 feet
high; thence the route conducts through Twilight Hall into Columbian Arch, which resembles a railroad tunnel, so symmetrical is the
excavation. Washington Avenue is next entered, which, followed, brings the visitor to Banditti Hall, where the ceiling rises to an
immense height, and the walls are jagged, as is the floor, with protruding rocks, so that this chamber is both forbidding in appearance and
difficult to traverse. At this point the main gallery branches, one avenue leading to what is known as the Old Cave, and the other
conducting by a longer route to more interesting apartments than those before passed. Through a narrow crevice the visitor gains a room
called the Bats’ Lodge, and beyond this is Rugged Mountain, which is in the center of a circular room, where Epsom salts of sparkling
purity and vast quantities of gypsum in efflorescent beauty cover the arched vault. Seen under torch-light the effect is indescribably
magnificent, and is the first striking intimation which the visitor receives of the extraordinary grandeur to which he will be presently
introduced. Following the long route we cross a lovely sand-deposit known as the Plain, but find an abrupt termination of this level walk and
are compelled to climb the rock-bestrewn Hill of Difficulty, then squeeze through a small passage-way from which we find present relief by
emerging into Wallace’s Grand Dome, one of the most magnificent chambers, as well as the largest, in the Cave, being 245 feet high and
300 feet in diameter. In the center is Monument Mountain, a tremendous stalagmite formation above which is an immense dome
beflowered with curling leaves of gypsum that bear a wondrous likeness to the foliage of the acanthus. At the apex of the mountain is a
stalagmite one hundred and twenty feet in circumference, which has been broken by some force into three columns, which, viewed from
the base, admirably counterfeit three monuments, or ghosts clad in robes of gleaming whiteness, from which fact the chamber takes its
name. Visitors are usually treated to a superbly grand sight while examining the splendors of this hall, for the guide disposes his
company about the base of the mountain, and ascending to the summit he extinguishes his torch in order to bring the visitors under the
influence of dense darkness for a few moments. Suddenly the peak is lighted up with a dazzling splendor, as the guide touches off
green, blue, red and orange lights, bathing the chamber in a sea of flaming beauty and bejewelling its lofty arch until Aladdin’s Cave of our
imagination is reproduced.</p>

Lake Lethe is the next water-basin, enclosed by walls ninety feet high, below which is a path that conducts to a pontoon at the neck of the lake. Thence a beach of the finest yellow sand extends for five hundred yards to Echo River, the largest of all, being nearly one mile long, from twenty to two hundred feet broad, and varying in depth from ten to forty feet.

Imagine great bunches of white, delicate, branching coral, twisting, curling and interlacing itself, serpent-like, into every conceivable fantastic shape, and you have only a faint idea of the truly extraordinary scenery of this glorious temple erected by Nature. In all directions are to be seen fantastic examples of stalactite formations, and marvelous decorations of whitest gypsum.

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>Beyond Wallace’s Dome there are a hundred halls of great magnificence, in nearly all of which are seen fantastic examples of
stalactite formations, and marvelous decorations of whitest gypsum, Milroy’s Temple being a very exhibition-room of these exquisite
curiosities: huge rocks, overhung by galleries of creamy stalactites, vermicular tubes intertwined, frozen cataracts and vine-like pendant
forms of stalactites, cluster along the walls in a profusion almost incredible. Imagine great masses of white delicate branching coral,
twisting, curling and interlacing itself, serpent-like, into every conceivable fantastic shape, and you have only a faint idea of the truly
extraordinary scenery of this glorious temple erected by nature. Other halls of almost rival splendor are known as Snowy Cliffs, Frosted
Rocks, Fairy Palace, Beauty’s Bower, The Throne, and Pillared Palace, in all of which gypsum and stalactites occur in the most charming
and imposing forms. Pillared Palace is particularly entrancing in its sumptuous and architecturally beautiful decorations. It is from
five to six feet high, forty or fifty feet wide and several hundred feet long. Its ceiling is a complete fringe-work of stalactites, while its
floor is as thickly set with stalagmites, many of which latter unite with the former, making the grandest pillars. Drapery of every
conceivable style may be seen, some of which is as transparent as crystal and rings like a silver bell when exposed to a light blow.
After Pillared Palace comes the Palace of the Genii, which for delicate formations even excels the former. Here are found stalactites
of every conceivable form, many of them as white as if they were made of sugar or whitest marble.</p>

<p class='c011'>Passing through Fairy Grotto, Neptune’s Retreat, and Hermit’s Cell, the visitor enters a larger chamber invested with the same
charming ornamentation, and in the center is a rich canopy of stalactite overhanging a stalagmite which has been likened by some
imaginative person to a chair richly upholstered. This is called the Throne, a designation appropriate enough, for it is one of the most
royally beautiful curiosities in the Cave, as the illustration will show.</p>

<p class='c011'>That portion known as the Old Cave, while scarcely so interesting as the galleries and vaults of the long route, contains several
halls of much interest and one, called the Senate Chamber, which rivals Wallace’s Dome. In the center of this room stands a mountain
whose top is covered many feet deep with stalactite formations, upon which stands the Pillar of the Constitution. This is an immense
stalagmite measuring seventy-five feet in circumference and thirty feet high, reaching from the top of the mountain to the ceiling above,
fluted and carved after a manner that would have put to shame the most extravagant architecture of Rome’s most halcyon days. The
world has not yet produced, so far as civilized man knows, anything of the kind to equal it. A writer says of it:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Before us arose a considerable hill, upon the top of which stood, like a column supporting the ceiling, a vast stalagmite like an
immense spectral-looking iceberg looming up before us, appearing as though it had just arisen from the foaming waves of the ocean, on a
dark and foggy night. In the uncertain light of our lamps it presented an appearance grand, if not appalling; but when the Drummond
light had been set off, all this changed to the most unearthly beauty. The ceiling above, with its long fringes of stalactites, came out to
view, and the great pillar could be seen in all its grandeur and beauty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond this is Pluto’s Ravine, where stands Stallasso’s Monument, a large white stalagmite, marked all over with pencil inscriptions,
some of them sixty years old, composing an autograph album of wonderful curiosity, containing hundreds of names which to fame
are otherwise unknown, and effusions of doggerel poets whose reputations, alas, will no doubt be forever restricted to the limits of this cave
chamber. A short distance beyond Pluto’s Ravine is the termination of this section of the Cave, and from this point return is made to the
open air. A ramble among the subterranean glories and petrified splendors of Wyandotte Cave was a fitting conclusion to one of the most
interesting tours that was ever taken through the picturesque regions of our country; a tour affording so much information, pleasure,
adventure, and profit, that the remembrance must forever remain a source of intense satisfaction and delight. It was with feelings of deep
regret that we separated after the completion of our work, and each returned to his respective home, to take up anew the old labor which
we had laid down when the start was made upon our long journey. During the trip our photographers took five thousand pictures; many
of these were taken under unfavorable conditions, and upon development were found unworthy of reproduction. Many others were
excellent and well deserving to rank with those which we have here used, but there is a limit to all things, and ours does not exceed the
space occupied by the 520 odd views which we have presented; these, however, are fairly representative of the incomparable scenery that
charmingly diversifies our native land, a land kissed by the lips of liberty, bounty, and beauty, and blessed with an amplitude of
powers, under the exercise of which the largest freedom, benefits and sovereign rights are obtained for the whole people.</p>
